For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome. This is not a reasonalbe option for everyone since it can be very time consuming vs. flying. Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome. We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray. It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10 - 15 minutes. My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do. He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart. This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms.	[723, 727, 731]	peanuts234.txt		1	0	1	0

So, on to why society sucks: Men are told to be a man, they have to be virile.

My son is severely allergic to peanuts and has allergic reactions as a result of being around people eating peanuts due to the peanut dust in the air. We had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist. The airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks. My son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip. Since he didn't eat any peanuts, we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat. We were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country. We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight. We may not be so lucky next time because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last. Even though we were on a peanut-free fight, my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight.

So I was an atheist until about two months ago, when I suddenly had a change of view (haha). But then I saw this (long) video: It really made me think about Christianity in a way I hadn't before. I had been very liberal but I was slowly turning more and more to the right, so I actually sought that video out to help that process. In the end I got a lot more. I sort of had a... feeling, both mental and almost even physical, that seemed to me like what people probably talk about when they say they 'found Jesus'. So I spent about a week or two full of invective, until it sort of petered out. At this point I feel like I could go either way, the very definition of agnostic I guess.

We had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist. The airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks. My son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip. Since he didn't eat any peanuts, we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat. We were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country. We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight. We may not be so lucky next time because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last. Even though we were on a peanut-free fight, my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight.	[174, 179]	peanuts776.txt		0	1	1	0

"In 2010 I was sued by a debt collector for a debt. At the time I was in my final year of law school and was surprised at the amount of misinformation used by the plaintiff's attorney (e.g. claiming that no proof of assignment was necessary). I informed the attorney that I would need proof that this was my debt as well as proof that his client had proper assignment of the debt. He responded by threatening (via e-mail) to interfere with my Bar admission process. I did not believe that an unsubstantiated debt would affect my ability to sit for the bar and so I stood my ground. He dropped the case (without prejudice) in Magistrate Court and then re-filed in State Court five months later while I was going through my Certification for Fitness process. As a result of his second lawsuit, the State Bar did not allow me to sit for the Bar due to ""a pending lawsuit"" about debt. He eventually also dropped the lawsuit in State Court. He never shared proof of this purported debt nor did he ever produce proof of assignment presumably because he never had valid proof of either). Nonetheless he was effective in ""punishing"" me by interfering with my ability to sit for the Bar after graduating from law school. this occurred in Georgia."	[1415, 1416, 1417]	cdcp302.txt		0	1	1	0

Then they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all. So handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns. Then it was shotguns only. Then you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar.

My son is severely allergic to peanuts and has allergic reactions as a result of being around people eating peanuts due to the peanut dust in the air. We had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist. The airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks. My son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip. Since he didn't eat any peanuts, we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat. We were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country. We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight. We may not be so lucky next time because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last. Even though we were on a peanut-free fight, my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight. If peanuts are banned on all flights, my son would have been safe.	[174, 179, 183]	peanuts776.txt		0	1	1	0

"As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one."

After having a perfect payment history for 15 years, I had to across the board default on six accounts because I became an unpaid caregiver for my parents. However, before I ever defaulted, I contacted each account and explained what was going on. I would also like to note that five of the six accounts were still being paid down until I ran out of savings. I discovered the credit card companies HAVE NO INTAKE for potential defaulters. I consider a potential default division a cost of doing business that credit card companies have eschewed because they have co-opted the courts to do all the work for them for a very nominal fee. My goal was simple, keep making monthly miniscule autopay payments on all six accounts in exchange for no harrassing phone calls so that I could concentrate on CareGiving AND modifying my self employment so that I could make something every month. Everyone refused, and the harrassing and MORE IMPORTANTLY REPETITIVE phone calls started. I ended up having to convert my land lines to 6 dollar a month cell phones, and then I rarely used them because I could not afford the 20 cents a minute cost. In essence the credit card companies and debt collectors destroyed the best way I had to regenerate earnings while still being an unpaid CareGiver.	[1452, 1455]	cdcp66.txt		0	1	0	0

I'm a tennis player so I'm going to use that as an analogy. In tennis, we often times practice new techniques with slow, hand-fed balls.

I can state from personal experience that when our savings ran out I became eligible for in home support services in which I as an unpaid caregiver could be paid a very modest amount (at minimum wage payment) because I was a caregiver. By being an in home CareGiver, I was saving the state a lot more money than it would cost to pay me a small amount every month via in home support services. I told this to all of my creditors, none of them cared. Then reality hit, my state agency that was supposed to help me obtain in home support services instead cast fear into both me and my parent by stating to me on the phone that whatever they paid me, they would file a lien on the home to get back if I outlived my parent. It turns out this application of the law did not apply to me. However the damage was done. I lost 1.75 years of eligibility and probably enough money to pay all of my vendors, and, I would have never had to prolong the default for more than a couple of months if any of my vendors had cared enough to just help me get through the process of applying for in home support services.

"I'm a Swede and I noticed as early as at the age of seven or eight that immigrants, or non-Swedes, were overrepresented in as good as all forms of crime and lowly behaviour. At the age of 12 I got in two fights, both with blacks. I won one and the other one was a draw since a teacher stepped in between. I didn't think much about it then, but a few months later I brought it up when a friend (also a Swede) and I were talking in school. He said ""of course they want to fight, they're negroes"". That's when I truly started suspecting that different peoples were inherently superior or inferior. At the age of 14 a majority of my class mates started listening to white power music in school and the racist comments were a natural part of the jargon. Around this time a nationalist (non-racist but not anti-racist) movement was growing in Sweden, which eventually reached the parliament and is growing as we speak. I joined them at the age of 16 and started believing that nationalism must not be a matter of ethnicity and race, but of identity and language. At the same time I started studying in secondary school. And the thing is that all the friends I made there are immigrants. The other Swedes in class treated me arrogantly. At the age of 17 I left the movement, confused and uncertain of what I should think. I started looking elsewhere and ended up being inspired and radicalised by far-left ideas. I started looking at the workers' movement in Sweden and was deeply impressed by its struggle through the ages and started feeling a deeper connection with my class and all the world's people. But as I joined in I was disappointed by the decay of the movement. I had read about a proud movement set on crushing oppression and opening up the world but what I met was a sorry clique of naive middle-class hobby-socialists who cared more about their veganism and apple-products than about class struggle. The only working-class people involved in the left were immigrants who cared about nothing else than getting more welfare money, more mosques and waving Palestinian flags anywhere thay go. I joined the left believing that we would fight chauvinism and religious oppression but the situation was the opposite. I still belive that socialism would be the optimal ideology but that it will never work in reality. I started looking back at nationalism but saw that the nationalist movement had changed. I remembered that the most stupid and violent member we had was a negroe. Another member was a radically catholic South American (why would I prefer that over Islam?). Moreover thair party is funded by Jews and is uncompromisingly pro-Israel (why would I prefer THAT over Islam?). There seems to be no side that fights for the entire world; either I fight with the ""nationalists"" for the Jews or with the ""socialists"" for the Muslims and negroes."

My 4 - year old daughter has a severe peanut allergy in addition to other food allergies not in consideration for this bill. We limit our flying to destinations beyond a 13 - hour drive by car. We try to fly peanut-allergy-friendly airlines when it is not cost prohibitive. When we do board an aircraft, we use baby wipes to clean our entire row of seats, seat belts, tray tables, and the seat back in front of us to remove peanut dust and residue. In spite of our best efforts to minimize allergen exposure to our daughter, flying is still a very stressful event. The few times we have flown, she invariably sneezes, scratches, and breaks out in hives; a far cry from anaphylaxis (which she has experienced, unfortunately), but still a real possibility that keeps us on edge throughout the entire flight. We do carry EpiPens and Benadryl everywhere we go, but for those who think having medication on hand in case of an allergic reaction is analogous to having spare Pampers on hand to change to dirty diaper, you are incredibly out of touch with reality, uninformed on the issue, or both.

I have had a nut allergy for my whole life and I am not just allergic to peanuts. I am actually allergic to all nuts. I can say from personal travel experience that when people eat nuts on an airplane I feel uncomfortable. I don't have an airborne allergy but I don't like the smell of peanuts being eaten around and in close proximity to me, especially when the air is being recirculated as it is in an airplane. I feel that airlines should strive to create the best experience possible and I don't see how they can do that when I sit in my seat and try to hold my breath for as long as possible in order to avoid the horrible smell of nuts. On a side note, the fact that they only serve peanuts is extremely inconvenient for me because then there is no food for me to eat as I am allergic to it.	[267, 271]	peanuts615.txt		0	1	0	0

I get itchy & runny eyes when I sit next to people who wear too much perfume or are wearing moldy clothes or have not bathed and have body odors. Should we run people through examinations before boarding the plane to see if they are emitting any smell that could cause allergy? And make them clean up or change clothes? I sneeze sometimes when near dogs and cats that give me allergic reaction. Should we ban all animals from any more flights? I have a problem when fat persons allow their body parts to hang over and under the arm rest next to me. It causes me to be nervous and can cause serious medical problems. Do you see how far reaching this can go? This must be stopped now. If people get sick in public it is their responsibility to stay out of public places. It is not the rest of us that must be subject to their health problems. I vote for peanuts to never be outlawed on any public transportation. If they are banned this means I could not bring my own either? Or I may be subject to being thrown off the plane because I have caused panic. I also do not like the smell of some food. It causes me to feel nauseous.	121	peanuts398.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

I have an allergic child who can have3 a severe reaction to tree nuts / peanuts & we have seen her go into anaphylactic shock from minimal exposure to allergens & have seen her react to contact.. touching a contaminated surface then touching her own skin / face. We have flown SOuthwest & Jet Blue, both very accommodating.. JB more than SW are so knowledgeable, know what snacks to remove & what ingredients to look for. They also make an announcement to request passengers refrain from eating their own snacks because of an allergic passenger.. and they are good about respecting privacy. SW removes snacks & allows preboard to wipe down seats, etc., but no announcement. They do have an alternative snack ready & know ahead of time that there will be a PA child on board as our itinerary gets double noted.. online & follow up phone call. JB also allows preboard so we can clean, they even offer their own anti bac wipes. I have heard horror stories about Delta who will only provied a buffer zone which is no help if the allergy is airborne or contact. We bring our own emergency meds which is only good for 20 min.	457	peanuts111.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0

As the father of a three year old daughter who was recently diagnosed with a life-threatening peanut allergy, I fully support a ban on peanuts and food containing peanuts. While my daughter does not have an inhalation allergy, she is extremely sensitive and if she ingested even a minute particle of peanut protein, she could have a life threatening reaction. While we have epi pens and benadryl to administer in the event of such an event, those medications are only a short term response and immediate medical care is essential. As a parent, it is my job to insure she does not ingest anything that will cause a reaction and we do everything we can to create a large buffer between her and such products. That said, we have little control over the environment in an airplane. Others eating peanuts nearby or even someone having eaten a peanut on an earlier flight could create a very real problem. While we can do everything possible to clean the area in which we sit and diligently parent her while on the flight, the risk is significant.	488	peanuts298.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0

Remember, you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal. or, will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier, check on your medications, where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions.

For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome. This is not a reasonalbe option for everyone since it can be very time consuming vs. flying. Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome. We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.	737	peanuts234.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0
It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10 - 15 minutes. My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do. He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart. This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms. It would be even scarier with a young child. The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne. Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water. My son is also allergic to milk and eggs. Nobody talks about banning them because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts. Traveling the world is an envigorating and enlightening experience that many would argue is as important as the structured education that we experience from 12 - 16 + years.

Once, I went into Anaphylaxis when a co-worker from a previous shift left some peanut oil and residue on a shared workstation. Remember, aircraft at altitude generally pressurize the cabin to 10,000 feet and when hundreds of those little bags packed at sea level are opened, the pressure difference propels the dust straight into the air... which I should remind everyone is not fresh air from outside but instead recirculated cabin air, so the offensive particles remain. There's no air exchange on a commercial aircraft, you're stuck with what you've got and yes I do carry two epi-pens but as others have already stated an epi-pen is only effective for 10 - 15 minutes and when deployed you must also report to an emergency room asap!	800	peanuts811.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0
history shows that it would be applied for bad purposes and that the solution proposed causes more problems than it solves. This isn't speculation, but rather the only conclusion that can be drawn from the USA's prior history of judicially mandated sterilization. One of the stated purposes [1] of the program was to prevent harm to children by rendering sterile those people who had demonstrated themselves to be abusive or neglectful to their children. In practice what happened was that the program was used to sterilize as many poor white people and black people as the law could manage (even when there was no evidence of abuse or neglect), and that rich white people were simply not forcibly sterilized even when abundant evidence of abuse existed.	807	cmv218.txt	DISCLOSURE OF HARM	0	0	0	0

we don't live in a perfect world. We live in a nation where the courts and police can be statistically shown to police minority groups more heavily than majority groups [2], we live in a world where the courts give longer sentences to minority groups than to majority groups [3]. Moreover, the courts have a statistically demonstrable tendency to simply not charge rich people, and on the rare occasion rich people do get into legal trouble they get lighter sentences than poor people (if for no other reason than that rich people can afford really great lawyers, while poor people get overworked public defenders). Further, we have historic evidence that the last time it was tried, mandatory sterilization was directed mainly against the poor and black.	810	cmv218.txt	DISCLOSURE OF HARM	0	0	0	0
I will say that I think the better solution is reality based, age appropriate, sex ed in schools, starting at kindergarten and continuing through graduation. And easily available free contraception. Because the truth is that most of the people who are having kids they abuse and neglect don't really want kids in the first place. This also isn't speculation, in nations where sex ed is better, and contraception is more affordable or paid for by the government, the rate of child abuse and neglect is lower than in the USA.

"I say ""one"" because another of the big stated purposes of the America's foray into court ordered sterilization was eugenics. [2] Example: the majority of people arrested for possession of marijuana are black, despite the fact that every study done to date has shown that black people use marijuana at a significantly lower rate than white people. All things being equal, you'd expect the majority of arrests for possession of marijuana to be white (not only are whites the majority, but they use pot more frequently). Yet black people get arrested for it more than white people.

But wait, you might say, there's a workaround. You can buy a small piece of land and live there in isolation without ever dealing with society. But I don't think so. First of all, I have to participate in some economy I don't believe in before I can even buy that land. This means that I have to get a job, get a car, do all the things that make us all miserable, and participate in an economy I never asked to be a part of just so I can opt out! Then after that, I would have to pay property taxes on that land every year. Thus, I am continually forced back into participating in an economy that I want no part in just to pay for the land that I need to escape it. The way I read this is that even the ""workaround"" to the essential problem posed in the previous paragraph forces me to participate in all these systems before I can even exercise the right to leave, and then once I do exercise my right to leave, the structures still force me to be bound to it. In other words, I have no viable means of escape.... which means that I am a slave, and my human rights are being continually violated."	952	cmv41429.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

Five years ago, I drastically cut back my consumption of meat and animal products. This was mostly for selfish reasons - my health. My new way of eating took some getting used to, and required a lot of effort learning how to cook tasty meat-free dishes. But over time I found that I took more pleasure in eating than ever before. Almost miraculously, my taste buds seemed to grow in sensitivity once the dominant flavors of animal meat and fat were removed, allowing me to enjoy a new world of culinary experiences. I love my whole foods, plant-based diet and will never go back. There's plenty of evidence to show that reducing meat and dairy consumption has health benefits (reduced heart disease, stroke, diabetes, etc). Although I made the switch for health reasons, I'm glad to be doing something good for the environment at the same time. And I'm deeply grateful not to be part of the horror show of industrial meat production.

My vegetarian / vegan dogs rarely passed gas and when they did it was not really repellently odoriferous. Similarly most human vege-vegans can allow themselves an occasional release of intestinal gas without having to feel that they have committed a social faux pas.

Ellie, you just keep digging yourself in deeper and deeper. I didn't just quote a few random vegans, I quoted people at the top of the largest veg orgs in the Nation. In other words, I had no problem at all demonstrating that it is not just fringe groups or something at the margins of the movement. Your claim that Bruce Friedrich is not a vegan was particularly laughable. You should have learned who he was before making such an embarrassingly ridiculous claim. Friedrich's life is dedicated to veganism. He even wrote the infamous essay, Defending Agitation and the ALF, which is a defense of the ALF's terrorist tactics, which the organization uses to justify their terrorism to this day. Again, Farm Sanctuary is one of the most prominent vegan orgs, not some fringe group within the movement. I got a good laugh out of your claim that I don't know vegans. My wife was one for years, and I have known many, many vegans. I also know people who have been threatened and attacked by vegan activists. For example, an acquaintance, a small, physically handicapped, middle-aged woman who was violently attacked by three vegan activists in the middle of a speech about the essential importance of animals in sustainable ag systems. It was very, very funny that you tried to deny any comparisons being made between omnivores and Nazis, and then did that yourself in the very same breath. Again, I proved it, and even cited a specific case here, so your claim is completely fallacious.	1140	veganism97.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

Change My View I just dont understand what is so great about this movie? It seems like a very basic plot-line. Robert De Niro's character is a guy jaded by war, who views the world from an outsider perspective, and as a result commits murder. My brother has been trying to get me to watch this movie for 3 years, and I've refused assuming I wouldn't like it, and now I've seen it, I wish I hadn't. I also don't fully understand how Jodie Foster was nominated for a Golden Globe off the back of this performance, when she was only present for roughly 15 minutes through-out the movie. Understanding that she was only 12 years old at the time, however, I don't think that should negate her limited contribution. I'm not sure whether I didnt like it because there was an impossible hype around the movie, or it really is over-rated. Please, try to change my view.	1373	cmv16526.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

Possibly the most egregious action of all regarding credit card debt occurred in 2002, suspiciously close to the 911 aftermath. While insurance companies were paying out tens of millions of dollars to building owners who suffered damage because of 911 (which technically they should not have done since this was an act of war which is NOT covered by most insurance plans), the comptroller of the currency was DENYING insurance companies from competing with credit card companies in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena. The result was a credit card debt suspension insurance monopoly for the credit card companies with premiums that were overpriced by a factor of 1000% to 2000% The profit margin was so high for credit card debt suspension insurance that the CFPB actually had to fine the credit card companies OVER 500 MILLION DOLLARS in the summer of 2012 for overly aggressive credit card debt suspension insurance sales and marketing practices.	1437	cdcp304.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

After having a perfect payment history for 15 years, I had to across the board default on six accounts because I became an unpaid caregiver for my parents. However, before I ever defaulted, I contacted each account and explained what was going on.

I ended up having to convert my land lines to 6 dollar a month cell phones, and then I rarely used them because I could not afford the 20 cents a minute cost.

At the age of 14 a majority of my class mates started listening to white power music in school and the racist comments were a natural part of the jargon. Around this time a nationalist (non-racist but not anti-racist) movement was growing in Sweden, which eventually reached the parliament and is growing as we speak. I joined them at the age of 16 and started believing that nationalism must not be a matter of ethnicity and race, but of identity and language. At the same time I started studying in secondary school. And the thing is that all the friends I made there are immigrants. The other Swedes in class treated me arrogantly.	1471	cmv22622.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0

But as I joined in I was disappointed by the decay of the movement.

Keep in mind that there are businesses or entities that allow people to receive credit for things they do not have money for at the moment. The business or entity, in good faith, extends credit to the consumer with the intent to receive payment at a later date. The business or entity was provided contact information by the consumer that it will use to collect or pass along to a collection agency to use to collect. The consumer can list whatever numbers or information they want and the business or entity must consider it to be truthful. Often the only way to determine if the information is accurate is to make a phone call.	1598	cdcp164.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

I don't say that one doesn't give up something to adhere to veganism. Years ago I had dreams of eating meat. Much of India is vegan, they are a spiritual people. We don't have the social support the Indians do, but possibly there are ways to connect with vegetarians more, and impose on carnivores less. On the other hand, articles like this one, and general signs throughout the culture, indicate flesh eating is moderating. That might go faster if meat eaters did their own slaughtering.	1611	veganism5.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

When the Beatles entered the scene (I wasn't around at the time, so this is taken from anecdotal evidence), much of the popular music was akin to what the Beatles released on Please Please Me, their first release. It was practically unheard of (at the time) for artists to progress the way that the Beatles did. Off the top of my head, I cannot think of a single artist that progressed as quick and as vast as they did in as little time, while still holding onto what made their music uniquely theirs. There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both [I Wanna Hold Your Hand] (and [Tomorrow Never Knows] (very different songs, I admit, and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large) in a way that is... natural. They progressed as opposed to mutated.	1650	cmv229.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

I, for one, have to contend with residue and airborne particulate from those little bags of roasted peanuts served on aircraft almost on a daily basis since I am an airline Captain. For 22 years I have been meticulous with keeping my work environment (flight deck) safe for me by not consuming items that may contain peanuts, avoiding touching my eyes and asking my co-pilot not to consume bagged peanuts (other peanut products that don't risk going airborne are usually ok). Unfortunately, my ability to control my environment becomes more difficult when I am assigned a reposition flight and must ride as a passenger. I advise the flight attendants and hope they remember. I have suffered mild / moderate anaphyalactic and asthmatic distress if I am unaware that someone opened a bag of peanuts. Thankfully that type of exposure is not life threatening (at least not yet) but the concern is very real. I am not a child, I am not traveling for pleasure and I don't have the power of completely removing something that can be life threatening for me while at work so I do the best I can to continue safely performing my duties as an airline pilot. I support the ban for airlines not to serve bagged peanut products and support the requirement that a public address announcement be made for those that have brought their own on board refrain from consuming them. When traveling in the cabin, I am always aware of those around me and what they are consuming. I have come to find that my sensitivity is mostly a distance of 1 row forward and back and two seats laterally (about 5 - 6 feet). If I can detect the odor of peanuts then I become concerned. In case you were wondering, yes I do carry an epinephrine auto injector (never used one), Allegra and antihistamine eye drops.	1720	peanuts400.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0

"As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city.

As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance. I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane. In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes. Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS. I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety. I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane. Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face. But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.	2211	peanuts482.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0

My son's dairy allergy is severe, and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk, which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department. Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse, but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut; he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild reaction.

"My son did have a reaction on one flights.

Then next time we flew where the airline served nuts, we told them of the allergy when we bought the tickets and when we checked in.

One flight attendant got angry that he wasn't told in advance and later blamed me when he ran out of non nut snacks when asked for a bag of pretzels (they created a ""peanut free area"" around us).

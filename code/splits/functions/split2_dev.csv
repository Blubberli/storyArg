If we don't have the same goals and the same perspective on monogamy then we probably shouldn't plan on being together for very long.	[912, 913]	cmv8.txt		1	0	0	0

"I had so many soft pulls (this was before I realized I needed to opt out of marketing) that my credit report from Equifax got ""split.""

Everything was GONE. After numerous fruitless attempts at reaching someone at Equifax, I finally got a real person. I was informed of the split and told that the burden was on me to provide them with the correct information to ""put my report back together.""

The first entity I will probably take to small claims court and possibly file a complaint with Kamala Harris.

I also faxed overnight warning those who might have access to that room that taking fax documents could lead to their arrest. I did this for several days in a row. It was the only way I could think of to apply a much needed enema to those who have established a routine and can't shake free from it. Of course this assumes that they care.

So it is just how it was with the gypsies in Slovenia. Exactly the same problem appears. In fact, gypsies in Slovenia are problematic because they do not want to work.

My child with a severe nut and peanut allergy had a reaction on a domestic flight. Luckily her breathing was not compromised but she broke out in hives across her entire body. I was very very close to using epi-pens on this flight and had all the flight attendants hovering around us. She only ate the safe food we brought onto the flight - nothing from the airline. I also wiped down our seating area before she boarded. However, she is very touch-sensitive and the seats are hard to clean as they are made of fabric. For the flight home we brought a sheet to cover the seats and she did not react the same way but did get a hive or two none-the-less.	[2283, 2284, 2285]	peanuts155.txt		1	1	1	0

What's with the brow-beating over milk? My diet is vegetarian. I haven't consumed regular milk for probably twenty years, although I do eat cheese in very small quantities, mostly imported Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cow's milk doesn't appeal to me any more than alternative milks do. It's simply personal preference. I'd rather drink water and eat the oats, nuts, or soybeans. It's more satisfying to my appetite than having them blended with water. That being said, other commenters have opened my eyes to the usefulness of alternative milks in cooking, and I appreciate that.	[1084, 1086]	veganism94.txt		0	0	1	1

In Belgium, so to speak, the situation is differentiated. The number of illegal immigrants who work is relatively big. They work illegally, because they live illegally and those people are often taken advantage of. These are people who live in centres for asylum-seekers and have problems with finding a decent work to earn a livelihood. There are also many of those who have started the asylum procedure and do not live in asylum-seekers centres, so they work on the market, but very often they work with no permit, this is the situation in Belgium.

if you have only a little (~ 1 beer), it will not have much of an effect on you. You might notice a small effect if you've never had it before, but you might not even notice it.

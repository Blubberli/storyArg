As a 95% Vegan, 99% Vegetarian, I am amazed and disturbed at the misplaced goal of such diet by many. My goal for this diet is health, environment and specifically sustainability of food sources. One can achieve these goals with much less percents. For example, one can be Vegan for five days a week and go crazy on weekends! Stay Vegetarian when eating at home and unconstrained when eating outside! Being extreme and militant defeats the goal of saving the environment.	[1181, 1182]	veganism96.txt		0	0	0	1

I personally don't want sex with anyone but my love. If she wants sex with other people it's fine, but it's a sign that we have different goals and feel different about each other.

Based on my own experience, buffer zones are pointless because of the poor job the airlines typically do cleaning planes in between flights. I have a peanut-allergic child, and even with an announced buffer zone, there are usually peanuts stuck in the seat cushions or lying on the floor from the previous flight.

My son is severely allergic to peanuts and has allergic reactions as a result of being around people eating peanuts due to the peanut dust in the air. We had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist. The airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks. My son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip. Since he didn't eat any peanuts, we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat. We were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country. We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight. We may not be so lucky next time because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last. Even though we were on a peanut-free fight, my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight. If peanuts are banned on all flights, my son would have been safe.	[174, 183]	peanuts776.txt		0	1	0	0

"I had so many soft pulls (this was before I realized I needed to opt out of marketing) that my credit report from Equifax got ""split.""

I was informed of the split and told that the burden was on me to provide them with the correct information to ""put my report back together.""

So it is just how it was with the gypsies in Slovenia. Exactly the same problem appears. In fact, gypsies in Slovenia are problematic because they do not want to work.

Interestingly enough, they did exactly this in the U.K. about thirty or so years ago. It all seems logical and practical and like it should work. Then they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all. So handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns. Then it was shotguns only. Then you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar. Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated. Firearms are essentially gone and crime is out of control.

I get repeated unknown calls on my cell, even though all creditors were sent written notices not to contact my cell number. I'm almost at a point that I cannot afford my cell, but if it give it up I have no way to get contact from a potential employer. When I get a full time job I will gladly pay my debts, but constant calls will not get the debt paid any faster. Not one company called me to give the the credit, so they should not call my cell and cost me more money that will prolong them getting paid. Besides, most of the calls are robo-calls with no message ever being left so I never know who the call is for.	[1110, 1115]	cdcp191.txt		0	1	0	0

After having a perfect payment history for 15 years, I had to across the board default on six accounts because I became an unpaid caregiver for my parents. However, before I ever defaulted, I contacted each account and explained what was going on. I would also like to note that five of the six accounts were still being paid down until I ran out of savings. I discovered the credit card companies HAVE NO INTAKE for potential defaulters. I consider a potential default division a cost of doing business that credit card companies have eschewed because they have co-opted the courts to do all the work for them for a very nominal fee. My goal was simple, keep making monthly miniscule autopay payments on all six accounts in exchange for no harrassing phone calls so that I could concentrate on CareGiving AND modifying my self employment so that I could make something every month. Everyone refused, and the harrassing and MORE IMPORTANTLY REPETITIVE phone calls started. I ended up having to convert my land lines to 6 dollar a month cell phones, and then I rarely used them because I could not afford the 20 cents a minute cost. In essence the credit card companies and debt collectors destroyed the best way I had to regenerate earnings while still being an unpaid CareGiver.	[1452, 1455]	cdcp66.txt		0	1	0	0

I'm a tennis player so I'm going to use that as an analogy. In tennis, we often times practice new techniques with slow, hand-fed balls. A coach will stand close and toss a ball easily up for us to hit. This gives the player additional time to process and understand their technique. For instance, if I were to learn a forehand from scratch I wouldn't want to go out and just start hitting it. This would leave me open to the possibility that I would do it incorrectly before the proper swing was ingrained in my head / body.	[358, 361, 362]	cmv289.txt		1	0	1	1

Recently we flew across the country and followed all of the procedures the airline gave us in turn they promised to clean seats and create a buffer zone to sheild my 3 year old son from any peanut exposure. As I walked to me seat expecting what I was promised I find left over peanuts in our seats! I came prepared with wipes and medicine just in case. The airline offered no assistance in fixing the problem. After cleaning everything up and getting all settled in, I had to hold my son for the next 5 hours because it was too risky. At the onset of an attack the use of an epi-pen would give us about 20 minutes to be in a hospital. During the snack a member of the flight crew pointed at us and told the other passengers that he could not offer them peanut M & Ms because there was an allergy sufferer on board.

Southwest is not nut free they will not serve nuts but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats. Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free' but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.

I am allergic to peanuts and almonds and I am impacted every time I fly. A nut free zone does not work since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane. For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts. For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food. This is not true for many of us with nut allergies - we react if other people are eating the food since it is an airborne allergy. I do fly but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.

Similarly most human vege-vegans can allow themselves an occasional release of intestinal gas without having to feel that they have committed a social faux pas.

Ellie, you just keep digging yourself in deeper and deeper. I didn't just quote a few random vegans, I quoted people at the top of the largest veg orgs in the Nation. In other words, I had no problem at all demonstrating that it is not just fringe groups or something at the margins of the movement. Your claim that Bruce Friedrich is not a vegan was particularly laughable. You should have learned who he was before making such an embarrassingly ridiculous claim. Friedrich's life is dedicated to veganism. He even wrote the infamous essay, Defending Agitation and the ALF, which is a defense of the ALF's terrorist tactics, which the organization uses to justify their terrorism to this day. Again, Farm Sanctuary is one of the most prominent vegan orgs, not some fringe group within the movement. I got a good laugh out of your claim that I don't know vegans. My wife was one for years, and I have known many, many vegans. I also know people who have been threatened and attacked by vegan activists. For example, an acquaintance, a small, physically handicapped, middle-aged woman who was violently attacked by three vegan activists in the middle of a speech about the essential importance of animals in sustainable ag systems. It was very, very funny that you tried to deny any comparisons being made between omnivores and Nazis, and then did that yourself in the very same breath. Again, I proved it, and even cited a specific case here, so your claim is completely fallacious.	1140	veganism97.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

For those saying that a small amount of peanuts in the air is not harmful, my child's throat closes up when he eats food that was processed in the same facility with peanuts and began this reaction on a plane with peanuts 5 rows in front of us. We would not travel on air planes if not for the fact that we have family in both Florida and New York. We cannot live near both. We have to avoid many restaurants that serve peanuts, and he cannot get ice cream at any place that offers peanuts as a topping.	1782	peanuts698.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted. And as a result of all this, not many of these cars are made, which make the price higher. The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4 - door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0 - 60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k.	1975	cmv241.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0
if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved * * significantly * * less stopping than the average driver makes.	2187	cmv46.txt	SEARCH FOR SOLUTION	0	0	0	0
Because I'm not single. And for the past 8 years or so, I've been horrible at remaining single, despite several sacred oaths to stop dating. But I'm also short, poor, unemployed, a few rare shades of mentally ill, a few common types of physically ill and I'm certainly not making up for it in looks. Did I mention I'm terrified to the point of flight or fight or, if I can't escape, fetal position paralysis when anything even vaguely sexual happens? Because it's not the social handicap you'd imagine. At least, not with other introverts... or trolls with a fucked up sense of humor.... So, yeah, my girlfriend is both of these. She likes it when other people are more afraid than her...	2190	cmv91.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

each of the supposed allergy sufferers (or parents thereof) start off by saying I / my child has a life threatening allergy etc., and then describe an incident where they were exposed to the supposed allergen and either nothing happened, or a MILD reaction occurred. Several times I see - 'I got nervous through the whole flight because I could smell peanuts', or, 'he broke out in hives and I was terrified', or itchy eyes and scratchy throat, etc.	2263	peanuts744.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0

Even in such a small town like Malbork, which counts 40 thousand inhabitants, I have observed that there are many changes, for example restoration of streets, sidewalks and building an entertainment arena, so I can see an improvement as well.	2269	europolis6.txt	SEARCH FOR SOLUTION	0	0	0	0

Polish workers went to England, Ireland, or Germany because they wanted to earn more money. It caused that many Ukrainians and Belarusians came to Poland and complement the builders.

I am not a peanut allergy sufferer, but as a physician, I have both taken care of children with acute peanut allergies, and also responded to calls for physicians on flights. The equipment and conditions available on a flight are laughable for a true emergency, and I truly don't see what the problem is with banning peanuts and products with peanuts in them on flights.	2354	peanuts839.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0

We already do this with CCW permits. The issue is that we have so many areas where you can't carry it or you can't carry it in across state lines (permit not seen as valid) that too many people leave them at home or in their cars or someplace other than on their person.	2385	cmv151.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

Then they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all. So handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns. Then it was shotguns only. Then you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar. Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated.	2387	cmv151.txt	ESTABLISH BACKGROUND	0	0	0	0

A good example of this sort of problem in the past was civil rights.

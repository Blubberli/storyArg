My friend, I have been around for almost 7 decades, travel to Europe regularly, and can assure you that consuming plant foods over animal based sources is here to stay and is not going to go away............ It is growing everywhere in the democratic industrialized world, including China. One place it is stagnant is Russia, and of all places, it is a somewhere that could greatly benefit from it.

The first entity I will probably take to small claims court and possibly file a complaint with Kamala Harris. The second incident I started sending faxes messages in big bold letters to the same fax where my prior faxes had been lost, asking other workers to look to see if they had taken the papers by accident. I also faxed overnight warning those who might have access to that room that taking fax documents could lead to their arrest. I did this for several days in a row. It was the only way I could think of to apply a much needed enema to those who have established a routine and can't shake free from it. Of course this assumes that they care.

So I was an atheist until about two months ago, when I suddenly had a change of view (haha). But then I saw this (long) video: It really made me think about Christianity in a way I hadn't before. I had been very liberal but I was slowly turning more and more to the right, so I actually sought that video out to help that process. In the end I got a lot more. I sort of had a... feeling, both mental and almost even physical, that seemed to me like what people probably talk about when they say they 'found Jesus'. So I spent about a week or two full of invective, until it sort of petered out. At this point I feel like I could go either way, the very definition of agnostic I guess. In a way I think I'd like to move towards Christ rather than away though...	[1562, 1563, 1564]	cmv47056.txt		1	0	1	0

We first discovered that my son's allergy to peanuts, included air born exposure while flying on a plane. He was 5 years old and asleep and started scratching his face, which also began to swell. I looked to the back of the plane and discovered that the stewards were passing out peanuts, which everyone was popping open. I asked her to stop immediately, which she did. I gave my son Benedryl and fortunately this sufficed-this time. We were very lucky. It is terrifying to be mid-flight and think that your child or loved one could die like this.

What's with the brow-beating over milk? My diet is vegetarian. I haven't consumed regular milk for probably twenty years, although I do eat cheese in very small quantities, mostly imported Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cow's milk doesn't appeal to me any more than alternative milks do. It's simply personal preference. I'd rather drink water and eat the oats, nuts, or soybeans. It's more satisfying to my appetite than having them blended with water. That being said, other commenters have opened my eyes to the usefulness of alternative milks in cooking, and I appreciate that.	[1084, 1086]	veganism94.txt		0	0	1	1

I have been working professionally as a sound engineer for 15 years. I'm not saying that the sound engineer is not also a part of the problem. The fault lies with many parties. As a sound engineer, I fight band stage volume on every band I work with. Many times I have a producer (who writes my paycheck) telling me to turn it up. The guitarist whose amp is turned up to eleven. The band manager who wants the whole thing turned up. The drummer. (Enough said.) And yes, many sound techs just turn it up because the sound system can get that loud, not realizing that there is a difference between can and should.

In Belgium, so to speak, the situation is differentiated. The number of illegal immigrants who work is relatively big. They work illegally, because they live illegally and those people are often taken advantage of. These are people who live in centres for asylum-seekers and have problems with finding a decent work to earn a livelihood. There are also many of those who have started the asylum procedure and do not live in asylum-seekers centres, so they work on the market, but very often they work with no permit, this is the situation in Belgium.

My 4 - year old daughter has a severe peanut allergy in addition to other food allergies not in consideration for this bill. We limit our flying to destinations beyond a 13 - hour drive by car. We try to fly peanut-allergy-friendly airlines when it is not cost prohibitive. When we do board an aircraft, we use baby wipes to clean our entire row of seats, seat belts, tray tables, and the seat back in front of us to remove peanut dust and residue. In spite of our best efforts to minimize allergen exposure to our daughter, flying is still a very stressful event. The few times we have flown, she invariably sneezes, scratches, and breaks out in hives; a far cry from anaphylaxis (which she has experienced, unfortunately), but still a real possibility that keeps us on edge throughout the entire flight. We do carry EpiPens and Benadryl everywhere we go, but for those who think having medication on hand in case of an allergic reaction is analogous to having spare Pampers on hand to change to dirty diaper, you are incredibly out of touch with reality, uninformed on the issue, or both.

Ellie, you just keep digging yourself in deeper and deeper. I didn't just quote a few random vegans, I quoted people at the top of the largest veg orgs in the Nation. In other words, I had no problem at all demonstrating that it is not just fringe groups or something at the margins of the movement. Your claim that Bruce Friedrich is not a vegan was particularly laughable. You should have learned who he was before making such an embarrassingly ridiculous claim. Friedrich's life is dedicated to veganism. He even wrote the infamous essay, Defending Agitation and the ALF, which is a defense of the ALF's terrorist tactics, which the organization uses to justify their terrorism to this day. Again, Farm Sanctuary is one of the most prominent vegan orgs, not some fringe group within the movement. I got a good laugh out of your claim that I don't know vegans. My wife was one for years, and I have known many, many vegans. I also know people who have been threatened and attacked by vegan activists. For example, an acquaintance, a small, physically handicapped, middle-aged woman who was violently attacked by three vegan activists in the middle of a speech about the essential importance of animals in sustainable ag systems. It was very, very funny that you tried to deny any comparisons being made between omnivores and Nazis, and then did that yourself in the very same breath. Again, I proved it, and even cited a specific case here, so your claim is completely fallacious.	1140	veganism97.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

"The Dalai Lama is a Buddhist. Buddhism is not yoga - - and Buddhism makes no demands that its practitioners should be vegetarian. (The Buddha wisely saw the impracticality of having mendicant Buddhist monks going on their alms rounds and saying to people as the people made their offerings, ""Sorry, I can't accept that, I'm a vegetarian."") Many Buddhists are vegetarian by choice - - but the Buddha made no requirement that they should be."	1227	veganism25.txt	CLARIFICATION	0	0	0	0

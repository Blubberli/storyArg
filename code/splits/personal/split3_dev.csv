He said that there is a part of the group which is extreme and wants to foist something on us. In my opinion, Holland has a problem with the legal system as it is not strict – weak, I would say. So one should consider what to do in order to improve this system and make it more efficient. If there were some sanctions, or punishments for these or other actions. When that murder was committed, I think everyone knows it was in Holland, everyone could see that the legal system was not able to impose an appropriate punishment for the guilty. So a jurisdiction should be developed, to be more strict. And I also believe that those fanatics should feel that sanctions could be imposed on them.

The rate for motorcycles is 72.34 per 100,000 registered motorcycles.[1] Motorcycles also have a higher fatality rate per unit of distance travelled when compared with automobiles. Per vehicle mile traveled, motorcyclists' risk of a fatal crash is 35 times greater than a passenger car.[1] In 2004, figures from the UK Department for Transport indicated that motorcycles have 16 times the rate of serious injuries compared to cars, and double the rate of bicycles.[2] &gt;A national study by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATS) found that: &gt;* Motorcycle rider death rates increased among all rider age groups between 1998 and 2000 &gt;* Motorcycle rider deaths were nearly 30 times more than drivers of other vehicles &gt;* Motorcycle riders aged below 40 are 36 times more likely to be killed than other vehicle operators of the same age. &gt;* Motorcycle riders aged 40 years and over are around 20 times more likely to be killed than other drivers of that same age.[3] &gt;Additional data from the United States reveals that there are over four million motorcycles registered in the United States.

Reacting with non vegans? Things might not go very well, especially if they haven't decided yet whether one fits with their circle. If others don't treasure you and your veganism, it is preferable to more or less dust them off. Not long ago these pages spotlighted the new luxury meat movement. Former vegans stepping up as purveyors of kinder, upscale food. An effort at compromise? Meat industry types with money might capitalize or otherwise encourage those; perhaps that money might also help influence media treatment towards anal-retentive stereotypes. I don't say that one doesn't give up something to adhere to veganism. Years ago I had dreams of eating meat. Much of India is vegan, they are a spiritual people. We don't have the social support the Indians do, but possibly there are ways to connect with vegetarians more, and impose on carnivores less. On the other hand, articles like this one, and general signs throughout the culture, indicate flesh eating is moderating. That might go faster if meat eaters did their own slaughtering.

Tiffany, the DOT is just recognizing a product that is being provided by companies that pose a serious threat to a fairly large number of people. Most other products aboard flights are considered non-allergenic or do not have particulates that become airborne which is the case with the bagged peanuts.  Also, finding another mode of transportation is not an option for me as I might be the Captain on your flight one day.

1975	319	620	HIGH	LOW	EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE	CLARIFICATION	False	NON-HUMAN	OTHER	CMV: I feel that high-end luxury cars (Bentley, Rolls Royce, etc.) are a complete and utter scam. What you're saying is that there's basically no tangible difference between a $100,000 luxury car and a Rolls Royce/Bentley. I'm no expert, but my understanding is that the difference is that they're basically hand made. Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted. And as a result of all this, not many of these cars are made, which make the price higher. The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4-door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0-60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k. I don't think it would be possible to easily produce and sell a car of similar quality for less. For people who have many millions (or billions) of dollars, the difference between a $100k and $250k for a luxury car isn't that big of a deal, and I think some rich people spend a lot of time in a car. Sometimes they just like to own a unique item, but also a status symbol can be worth a lot of money sometimes. If the car helps you to secure a billion dollar deal, it was a good investment. edit: typo	[]	[]	Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted.

2187	1047	1384	MEDIUM	LOW	EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE	SEARCH FOR SOLUTION	True	NON-HUMAN	OTHER	CMV: : I believe that the fuel economy benefits offered by hybrid cars is a myth due to a basic understanding of physics. &gt;1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking). [According to the Prius wiki]( the battery pack weighs 118 lbs. Since I can't find a figure online, let's say the electric motor components (which are the major components for regenerative braking) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing. So 218 pounds out of a total of around [2900 lb curb weight]( puts ~7.5% more weight onto the vehicle. Not as much as one might think. (It's also the weight of a full grown adult, so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo. Yes, that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy but it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking. &gt;It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved **significantly** less stopping than the average driver makes. At steady speed highway driving, you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size/efficiency combustion engines because it is simple physics. What you don't seem to be taking into account (or at least understating the importance of) is regenerative braking. 100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking. Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [as much as 50%]( of that energy. For the sake of keeping things honest, let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient. See the importance of regenerative braking? Using Newton's 2nd law, we can estimate that to get up to speed, Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy (and fuel) than Non-Hybrid X, but then when they both stop, Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses. This is especially important because vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed (Newton's 1st law). Yes, weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road, but the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all. So to summarize: Driving at a steady speed - slightly better fuel economy for non-Hybrids. Driving with braking - significantly better fuel economy for Hybrids. So like I said before, unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving (and even then the highway better not be very busy), a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart.

What is really telling in this entire discussion, is that each of the supposed allergy sufferers (or parents thereof) start off by saying I/my child has a life threatening allergy etc., and then describe an incident where they were exposed to the supposed allergen and either nothing happened, or a MILD reaction occurred.  Several times I see - 'I got nervous through  the whole flight because I could smell peanuts', or, 'he broke out in hives and I was terrified', or itchy eyes and scratchy throat, etc.  Not one of these posters is mentioning an actual serious reaction that led to death or extended hospitalization.  Hives, itchy eyes, scratchy throat - all unpleasant, but hardly life threatening.  If peanuts are so deadly, why aren't we hearing from ANYONE that has actually lost a loved one to them?  Could it be that the fear is illusory?  In a response to one of my earlier posts someone said that 100 to 200 people die of food allergies each year.  No citation or support is offered for this # so its accuracy can only be speculated.  The reply goes on to say 'the majority of those are caused by peanuts' - once again without citation.  Even if these #s were accurate, this is not a statistically significant portion of the population.  There is a huge gap here between perception and reality.  As Mr. Mulder correctly pointed out, when you are told over and over that peanuts will kill you, you may well have a reaction when you believe you have been exposed to them.  The problem is, it is a stress induced reaction (also called panic attack), NOT an allergy.  The fact is, numerous peer reviewed studies have found serious food allergies to be incredibly rare, and life threatening reactions to be so rare as to approach statistical ZERO.  The majority of self-reported allergics who have been actually studied do not react when given the supposed allergen in a controlled environment.    So, if actual science determines that there is a real risk to a statistically significant portion of the population, I will gladly surrender my peanuts.  The peanut people are correct about one thing, my enjoyment of a snack is not more important than actual lives.  The thing is, it has not been proved, has not even been reasonably implied that my peanuts are putting ANYONE at risk.

2382	64	705	MEDIUM	MEDIUM	EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE	CLARIFICATION	False	NON-HUMAN	OTHER	"CMV: Here's what I would change about American gun regulations. Interestingly enough, they did exactly this in the U.K. about thirty or so years ago. It all seems logical and practical and like it should work. Then they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all. So handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns. Then it was shotguns only. Then you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar. Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated. Firearms are essentially gone and crime is out of control. So what was the critical difference? As was pointed out, it's that your argument pre-supposes that firearms are a priviledge and not a right. You go into the creation of the list with a view that logically will lead you down this path. But let's get into each statement/idea. Because some are good, and some are not. And this isn't really abot how you set up the argument so much as the individual points. 1 - This sounds great. But this is alrady what happens with concealed carry permits. A smarter approach would be to make a nationwide standard and database for CCW permits (it's a hodge-podge of conflicting laws currently and some states accept others, some do not), Also, make a concerted effort to promote such permit ownership to our youths (say, training leading up to a full permit at adulthood) and as part of self-defense programs and so on. We need more firearms in the hands of good, trained citizens. 2 - Absolutely. We do this in California already to buy any firearm. But the issue again is every state has its own rules and laws. There needs to be one database and one standard for all states. I know I'm a big proponent of States rights, but in many ways, the patchwork of laws creates more headache that it's worth when we're trying to tackle a natiowide problem. 3 - Unfortunately this is completely unworkable. Given that you can reload your own ammo for pennies a round, and hundreds of millions of rounds are already in private hands, it's never going to happen. 4 - Correct. People will just load their own or drive across town to where it's not taxed. TO make this work, it would have to be one law for the entire U.S. But then there's issues with unfair taxes vs states rights and that would simply take decades to deal with in the courts. Federal regulations are one thing, but adding an ""ammo tax"" which it would be called, is a political quagmire. 5 - We already do this with CCW permits. The issue is that we have so many areas where you can't carry it or you can't carry it in across state lines (permit not seen as valid) that too many people leave them at home or in their cars or someplace other than on their person. This also needs to be cleaned up at the Federal level. A higher level permit as you suggest would possibly let you carry in such paces, like bounty hunters and guards do. Promote this as possibly some sort of deputy corps to help out the overworked police. 6 - They already do this in most states. The issue is... wait for it... the states that don't. 7 - Unworkable, really. 8 - This is almost the law in some states already. I see no issue with it, really. As a firearm owner, your responsibility to secure it is exactly that. Fines should seem appropriate. But then again, if they steal your entire safe, it shouldn't be entirely your fault. 9 - Lastly, this is a must. A good example of this sort of problem in the past was civil rights. When you left it up to every city and state to have different laws about voting rights, laws, police enforcement, and so on, it was a social and emotional nightmare. Only when you made it one law for everyone did we get compliance and the start of a workable system."	[]	[]	Interestingly enough, they did exactly this in the U.K. about thirty or so years ago.

Interestingly enough, they did exactly this in the U.K. about thirty or so years ago. It all seems logical and practical and like it should work. Then they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all. So handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns. Then it was shotguns only. Then you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar. Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated. Firearms are essentially gone and crime is out of control. So what was the critical difference? As was pointed out, it's that your argument pre-supposes that firearms are a priviledge and not a right. You go into the creation of the list with a view that logically will lead you down this path. But let's get into each statement/idea. Because some are good, and some are not. And this isn't really abot how you set up the argument so much as the individual points. 1 - This sounds great. But this is alrady what happens with concealed carry permits. A smarter approach would be to make a nationwide standard and database for CCW permits (it's a hodge-podge of conflicting laws currently and some states accept others, some do not), Also, make a concerted effort to promote such permit ownership to our youths (say, training leading up to a full permit at adulthood) and as part of self-defense programs and so on. We need more firearms in the hands of good, trained citizens. 2 - Absolutely. We do this in California already to buy any firearm. But the issue again is every state has its own rules and laws. There needs to be one database and one standard for all states. I know I'm a big proponent of States rights, but in many ways, the patchwork of laws creates more headache that it's worth when we're trying to tackle a natiowide problem. 3 - Unfortunately this is completely unworkable. Given that you can reload your own ammo for pennies a round, and hundreds of millions of rounds are already in private hands, it's never going to happen. 4 - Correct. People will just load their own or drive across town to where it's not taxed. TO make this work, it would have to be one law for the entire U.S. But then there's issues with unfair taxes vs states rights and that would simply take decades to deal with in the courts. Federal regulations are one thing, but adding an ""ammo tax"" which it would be called, is a political quagmire. 5 - We already do this with CCW permits. The issue is that we have so many areas where you can't carry it or you can't carry it in across state lines (permit not seen as valid) that too many people leave them at home or in their cars or someplace other than on their person. This also needs to be cleaned up at the Federal level. A higher level permit as you suggest would possibly let you carry in such paces, like bounty hunters and guards do. Promote this as possibly some sort of deputy corps to help out the overworked police. 6 - They already do this in most states. The issue is... wait for it... the states that don't. 7 - Unworkable, really. 8 - This is almost the law in some states already. I see no issue with it, really. As a firearm owner, your responsibility to secure it is exactly that. Fines should seem appropriate. But then again, if they steal your entire safe, it shouldn't be entirely your fault. 9 - Lastly, this is a must. A good example of this sort of problem in the past was civil rights. When you left it up to every city and state to have different laws about voting rights, laws, police enforcement, and so on, it was a social and emotional nightmare.

I know I'm a big proponent of States rights, but in many ways, the patchwork of laws creates more headache that it's worth when we're trying to tackle a natiowide problem. 3 - Unfortunately this is completely unworkable. Given that you can reload your own ammo for pennies a round, and hundreds of millions of rounds are already in private hands, it's never going to happen. 4 - Correct. People will just load their own or drive across town to where it's not taxed. TO make this work, it would have to be one law for the entire U.S. But then there's issues with unfair taxes vs states rights and that would simply take decades to deal with in the courts. Federal regulations are one thing, but adding an ""ammo tax"" which it would be called, is a political quagmire. 5 - We already do this with CCW permits. The issue is that we have so many areas where you can't carry it or you can't carry it in across state lines (permit not seen as valid) that too many people leave them at home or in their cars or someplace other than on their person. This also needs to be cleaned up at the Federal level. A higher level permit as you suggest would possibly let you carry in such paces, like bounty hunters and guards do. Promote this as possibly some sort of deputy corps to help out the overworked police. 6 - They already do this in most states.

As a firearm owner, your responsibility to secure it is exactly that. Fines should seem appropriate. But then again, if they steal your entire safe, it shouldn't be entirely your fault. 9 - Lastly, this is a must. A good example of this sort of problem in the past was civil rights. When you left it up to every city and state to have different laws about voting rights, laws, police enforcement, and so on, it was a social and emotional nightmare.

Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated. Firearms are essentially gone and crime is out of control. So what was the critical difference? As was pointed out, it's that your argument pre-supposes that firearms are a priviledge and not a right. You go into the creation of the list with a view that logically will lead you down this path. But let's get into each statement/idea. Because some are good, and some are not. And this isn't really abot how you set up the argument so much as the individual points. 1 - This sounds great. But this is alrady what happens with concealed carry permits. A smarter approach would be to make a nationwide standard and database for CCW permits (it's a hodge-podge of conflicting laws currently and some states accept others, some do not), Also, make a concerted effort to promote such permit ownership to our youths (say, training leading up to a full permit at adulthood) and as part of self-defense programs and so on.

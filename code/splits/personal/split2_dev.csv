While I'm not personally a huge drinker of alcohol, I think I can convince you that should sometimes drink it.

If she wants sex with other people it's fine, but it's a sign that we have different goals and feel different about each other. If she values sex with other people over what we have together than the relationship is over. If we don't have the same goals and the same perspective on monogamy then we probably shouldn't plan on being together for very long. Some people like swinger parties, casual sex with strangers and having fuck buddies. Some people have sex for a living and still manage to have meaningful relationships. It's just a matter of your personal relationship and what your goals are as a couple.

While I don't share my dad's side of the family's viewpoints whatsoever, a lot of the guilt over sex seems to remain. I think my view on sex is rooted in jealousy. I have difficulty with the concept of that period in dating where you've begun to have sex with someone, but you are not committed to one another yet. I think this really holds me back. This is not even to start with the concept of one-night stands, which I similarly would have extreme difficulty going through with. The problem is, I think none of these views on sex are rooted in healthy motivations. I think I avoid one-night stands because it's difficult to admit that some women will not be attracted enough to me to want a relationship, but are attracted enough to want to have sex. Secondly, I feel like there's an unhealthy possessiveness in wanting instant commitment. While I recognize these things on a conscious level, it's very hard for me to get to the root of what I feel to change it.

If you ""properly raise"" cattle, you fertilize a pasture, you do not fertilize crops for human consumption. Of course, some of the increasing number of produce recalls are because of cross-contamination, combined with the increasingly harmful strains of salmonella and other species that crowding supports. And if we properly raised cattle, there'd be vastly fewer. Ditto the pigs, the chickens, and the goats that have stripped countless islands practically to bare rock with their destructive habits.

2187	1047	1384	MEDIUM	LOW	EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE	SEARCH FOR SOLUTION	True	NON-HUMAN	OTHER	CMV: : I believe that the fuel economy benefits offered by hybrid cars is a myth due to a basic understanding of physics. &gt;1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking). [According to the Prius wiki]( the battery pack weighs 118 lbs. Since I can't find a figure online, let's say the electric motor components (which are the major components for regenerative braking) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing. So 218 pounds out of a total of around [2900 lb curb weight]( puts ~7.5% more weight onto the vehicle. Not as much as one might think. (It's also the weight of a full grown adult, so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo. Yes, that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy but it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking. &gt;It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved **significantly** less stopping than the average driver makes. At steady speed highway driving, you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size/efficiency combustion engines because it is simple physics. What you don't seem to be taking into account (or at least understating the importance of) is regenerative braking. 100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking. Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [as much as 50%]( of that energy. For the sake of keeping things honest, let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient. See the importance of regenerative braking? Using Newton's 2nd law, we can estimate that to get up to speed, Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy (and fuel) than Non-Hybrid X, but then when they both stop, Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses. This is especially important because vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed (Newton's 1st law). Yes, weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road, but the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all. So to summarize: Driving at a steady speed - slightly better fuel economy for non-Hybrids. Driving with braking - significantly better fuel economy for Hybrids. So like I said before, unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving (and even then the highway better not be very busy), a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart.

I have an alternate solution to suggest: airline provided surgical masks to prevent airborne contamination and either thoroughly sanitized seating to prevent skin contact with oils left by previous passengers or, for those who don't feel secure in sanitization procedure, sealed cleanroom suits available upon request. A quick Google check turned up boxes of 50 medical grade surgical masks for $22, a company named Microarray selling individually sealed cleanroom suits with hood and boots for $27.45 each, and a 40 pack of latex gloves for $6. This provides a cheap and perfectly effective solution to what is, apparently, a very occasional problem. These masks and suits are considered safe enough to avoid contamination in the most sensitive of settings: operating rooms, high technology clean rooms, etc. They should be safe enough to avoid any chance of accidental inhalation or contact with peanut allergens. One thing I like about this as a solution is that it works equally well for all forms of airborne allergens, not just peanuts. What do you all think?

Finally, if necessary, I am more than prepared to either 1) give an affected passenger food that we brought on the plane that is peanut safe if they are really hungry (we always bring plenty of extra 'safe' food) or will gladly fork over the additional $5-$50 to buy them/their family whatever in-flight food they want if it means that they will not expose my family to peanut allergens in close proximity.

I agree with Steyermark's comments in many ways - a full ban on peanut products is unenforceable and not practical.  In my family, we read labels, understand where the labels may not give all of the information, etc... This is not something that will be done by the majority of people.  Also, foods like PBJ sandwiches are really easy to fly with - no refrigeration required.  So, what I think needs to happen: 1) The airlines themselves do not serve peanut products 2) The airlines have clearly documented/posted allergy policies with education of staff (and encouragement of passenger awareness of these policies) to increase awareness that there may need to be some seat flexibility for people intending to eat peanut products from home during the flight if seated near peanut-allergic individuals.  A key reason for this is that people deal with change better when it is expected, so if there is education in advance regarding these policies and issues, then seat changes or similar interventions are more likely to go smoothly.  Overall, I can foresee that this may be a bit inconvenient and people affected may find this to be an annoyance, but, in the grand scheme of things, this is not that big of a deal.  A policy could consist of identifying those in close proximity to the peanut-allergic individual and giving them a handout that asks if they have peanut products that they are going to be eating.  If so, they should notify the flight attendant and some sort of seating rearrangement will occur in a way to maximize safety and minimize inconvenience.  This will require flexibility and generosity of spirit on the part of all people involved (and I do recognize is likely to be annoying) but, in truth, is not that big of a deal when compared to a significant safety issue.

But I was [pressed]( for specifics, so these are some of the possibilities I think are reasonable. Please tell me what you think of these, and tell me what else you would like the government to do. 1. If you aren't properly licensed, you can't own or possess a gun. Getting a license means demonstrating some kind of proficiency related to safely and responsibly storing and using the weapon. Like a driver's license. And like a driver's license, demonstrating increased levels of proficiency and responsibility means you can own more (and more destructive) weapons, or even carry them in public. I'm not reflexively opposed to private ownership of, say, semiautomatic handguns, assault weapons or large magazines. But I'd like owners of those kinds of weapons to undergo frequent and intrusive recertifications, with the intrusiveness and frequency tied to the lethality of the weapons/magazines. 2. Getting a license involves background checks and some kind of mental health evaluation. The more significant the license, the deeper the checks. 3. You can't buy or own ammunition without a license. Maybe there should be restrictions or bans on especially destructive ammo. 4. I've heard suggestions of an exorbitant tax on ammunition. CMV, but I don't see how that helps. 5. If you are in possession of a firearm, you need to be able to demonstrate that you acquired it legally and are properly licensed. Just like a car. ""License and registration please."" 6. All firearms must be traceable. You can't sell a firearm except to someone licensed to own it. All firearms must be individually identifiable, and all firearms sales must be recorded and tracked.

If a firearm is used in a crime or is found in the wrong hands, the weapon's registered owner must be held to account. If you lost it or it was stolen from you, your license is suspended, downgraded or revoked because ipso facto you didn't meet your responsibility for safeguarding it. 9.

I think the large majority of the population doesn't understand that a severe peanut allergy is unlike other allergy. Many people think ""oh I have allergies-I take an antihistamine when I get itchy or feel sick"". People with  a severe allergy can die from a reaction to the peanut protein in the closed confines of a plane with recirculated air. This is not an irrational fear, but rather based in the reality that you can take all the proper precautions, but there is nothing you can do if the peanut protein is in the air on a plane. It's not like you can go outside for fresh air. An epi-pen is only a stop gap solution. It lasts for 15-20 minutes and allows the sufferer time to get to an emergency room for further treatment. We first discovered that my son's allergy to peanuts, included air born exposure while flying on a plane. He was 5 years old and asleep and started scratching his face, which also began to swell. I looked to the back of the plane and discovered that the stewards were passing out peanuts, which everyone was popping open. I asked her to stop immediately, which she did. I gave my son Benedryl and fortunately this sufficed-this time. We were very lucky. It is terrifying to be mid-flight and think that your child or loved one could die like this. It is also very disheartening to read comments from people who feel that their freedom is impinged upon by not being allowed to eat a certain food for the length of a flight. It seems a minor inconvenience to be asked to refrain from a food preference for such a short time in order to save another's life. A peanut free zone will not work because of the air born peanut protein in recirculated air. If peanuts are only banned on a flight with an allergy sufferer, does the plane get new fresh air before a new group of passengers boards for another flight?  If many passengers decided they were going to bring a peanut containing candy bar on the plane, this too could create a serious allergic reaction. I also think that the airlines should be required to carry epi-pens and an emergency kit to be prepared to treat a variety of  emergencies, since once up in the air we are captive to what is available. The reason nobody ever died from an anaphylactic peanut reaction on a flight is because the parents of children with this allergy go to great lengths to make sure the flight is peanut free and often meet with the disdain of flight personnel when reminding them on boarding of the need for a peanut free flight and to make an announcement to not eat peanut products on the plane.

I'm not inclined to agree with banning peanuts on all planes - at least not until someone bans sick people from planes, too. I mean, really, what is worse for a planeful of people - a peanut, or the person next to them coughing and sneezing without covering their mouths and tossing used tissues on tray tables and in seatback holders that will never, ever be cleaned?  I can't tell you how many times I've sat within spitting range of those germfests, and it's more detrimental to me and my health than any shellfish I could be exposed to (I'm allergic to seafood).    I think in general it's the responsibility of the allergy sufferer to deal with their allergies, not the people around them. If someone is allergic to peanuts (via ingestion) the just don't freaking eat the peanuts.  It is that simple. People around that person shouldn't be banned because someone who is allergic to peanuts might be dumb (or hungry) enough to eat the mini bag.  Not only that, a lot of foods are made with labels that say ""may contain traces of peanuts"" - are those not allowed on planes, either?  What are people supposed to eat on long flights?  Or are they supposed to only buy the overpriced, dried out sandwiches airlines served and/or eat the microwaved food?  If you're going to ban peanuts, someone better step up the regulation of the junk that is passed off as ""food"" on planes.

This is not even to start with the concept of one-night stands, which I similarly would have extreme difficulty going through with. The problem is, I think none of these views on sex are rooted in healthy motivations. I think I avoid one-night stands because it's difficult to admit that some women will not be attracted enough to me to want a relationship, but are attracted enough to want to have sex. Secondly, I feel like there's an unhealthy possessiveness in wanting instant commitment. While I recognize these things on a conscious level, it's very hard for me to get to the root of what I feel to change it.

I don't necessarily disagree with you, as I believe everyone should be respected, but here is the argument I think makes the most sense with regards to why it may be ok (in the minds of many) to respect homophobes less than other people: Homophobes are not respectful of everyone. Since homophobes are not respectful of everyone simply for being human, many people consider them fair game to disrespect. Esseintially they forfeit their right to be respected by disrespecting others. I think this argument is a little hypocritical, at least how I phrased it, but it isn't entirely irrational. I am an American, and we tend to value freedom, but you quite simply can't have every freedom out there. You cannot allow all people to be free to have jobs and live where they like while also allowing perfect freedom to discriminate on the part of employers and landlords. Therefore the United States has been (slowly) siding more and more with limiting the freedoms that limit other freedoms. This is not the exact same thing but it is similar. Essentially the thought goes that we should respect the beliefs of all others, but when there is a conflict we will respect those who disrespect others less than those who don't. The part that doesn't convince me is that it assumes that respect is some limited thing that cannot be given out to everyone (as opposed to freedom which clearly can't), whereas I believe that it is possible to respect people who have radically different beliefs than I do. That being said, I do not respect all people equally. I have a fair amount of respect for everyone, but there are definitely some people who I respect more than others and some I hold in slightly lower regard. This is often a factor of a nubmer of things about a person. I value traits like kindness, loyalty, leadership, a good work ethic, creativity, intelligence, and open-mindedness, to name a few. When someone is pretty bad at some of these things I tend to respect them a little less than someone who displays them quite well. Homophobes are terribly closed-minded. I honestly find it impossible to respect a homophobe as much as another person who is equally respectable in every other way. It is definitely a knock against them. I try my best not to belittle them and to treat them with human decency (hold the door open, smile and be polite, be friendly, etc.), but only because I do that to everyone. I do not respect them enough to take most of their opinions seriously, at least on the topic of society and laws. With regards to the ""witch-hunt"" I am actually not very bothered by it. I strongly believe that gay people should have equal rights, and a large and growing number of people agree with me. There are still many people who don't but it is becoming increasingly more difficult for them to be open about it, which I see as a good thing. The message being sent is that it is not ok to be homophobic. Maybe it is not being sent in the nicest of ways as it tells homophobes that their beliefs are not ok (which is always hard to hear and tends to make people defensive as you noted) but it is an important message to send and I would rather it happen poorly than not at all."

1934	1549	2645	MEDIUM	LOW	EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE	CLARIFICATION	False	INDIVIDUAL	FIRST-HAND	"CMV: Homophobes deserve the same respect as anyone else. I don't necessarily disagree with you, as I believe everyone should be respected, but here is the argument I think makes the most sense with regards to why it may be ok (in the minds of many) to respect homophobes less than other people: Homophobes are not respectful of everyone. Since homophobes are not respectful of everyone simply for being human, many people consider them fair game to disrespect. Esseintially they forfeit their right to be respected by disrespecting others. I think this argument is a little hypocritical, at least how I phrased it, but it isn't entirely irrational. I am an American, and we tend to value freedom, but you quite simply can't have every freedom out there. You cannot allow all people to be free to have jobs and live where they like while also allowing perfect freedom to discriminate on the part of employers and landlords. Therefore the United States has been (slowly) siding more and more with limiting the freedoms that limit other freedoms. This is not the exact same thing but it is similar. Essentially the thought goes that we should respect the beliefs of all others, but when there is a conflict we will respect those who disrespect others less than those who don't. The part that doesn't convince me is that it assumes that respect is some limited thing that cannot be given out to everyone (as opposed to freedom which clearly can't), whereas I believe that it is possible to respect people who have radically different beliefs than I do. That being said, I do not respect all people equally. I have a fair amount of respect for everyone, but there are definitely some people who I respect more than others and some I hold in slightly lower regard. This is often a factor of a nubmer of things about a person. I value traits like kindness, loyalty, leadership, a good work ethic, creativity, intelligence, and open-mindedness, to name a few.

What you're saying is that there's basically no tangible difference between a $100,000 luxury car and a Rolls Royce/Bentley. I'm no expert, but my understanding is that the difference is that they're basically hand made. Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted. And as a result of all this, not many of these cars are made, which make the price higher. The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4-door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0-60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k. I don't think it would be possible to easily produce and sell a car of similar quality for less. For people who have many millions (or billions) of dollars, the difference between a $100k and $250k for a luxury car isn't that big of a deal, and I think some rich people spend a lot of time in a car. Sometimes they just like to own a unique item, but also a status symbol can be worth a lot of money sometimes. If the car helps you to secure a billion dollar deal, it was a good investment. edit: typo	[]	[]	Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted.

You cannot separate individual issues at all--you have a few packages to choose from, no matter how much you may disagree with parts of each. By the very nature of this, voters are encouraged to agree with one side on all or almost all things. Because a person chooses to support a side, views presented by that side will tend to appear ""better"" than views presented by the other side, regardless of the views themselves. People who join and actively support one political party or another submit to a certain degree of mob mentality. The United States has many corrupt government officials and something of a culture of dissatisfaction with elected officials. I see this, in large part, as a result of voting. Voting selects for traits such as charisma, popular appeal, and so forth, rather than competency in governing. In addition, the process encourages--almost necessitates--lying.

2187	1047	1384	MEDIUM	LOW	EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE	SEARCH FOR SOLUTION	True	NON-HUMAN	OTHER	CMV: : I believe that the fuel economy benefits offered by hybrid cars is a myth due to a basic understanding of physics. &gt;1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking). [According to the Prius wiki]( the battery pack weighs 118 lbs. Since I can't find a figure online, let's say the electric motor components (which are the major components for regenerative braking) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing. So 218 pounds out of a total of around [2900 lb curb weight]( puts ~7.5% more weight onto the vehicle. Not as much as one might think. (It's also the weight of a full grown adult, so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo. Yes, that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy but it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking. &gt;It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved **significantly** less stopping than the average driver makes. At steady speed highway driving, you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size/efficiency combustion engines because it is simple physics. What you don't seem to be taking into account (or at least understating the importance of) is regenerative braking. 100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking. Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [as much as 50%]( of that energy. For the sake of keeping things honest, let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient. See the importance of regenerative braking? Using Newton's 2nd law, we can estimate that to get up to speed, Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy (and fuel) than Non-Hybrid X, but then when they both stop, Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses. This is especially important because vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed (Newton's 1st law). Yes, weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road, but the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all. So to summarize: Driving at a steady speed - slightly better fuel economy for non-Hybrids. Driving with braking - significantly better fuel economy for Hybrids. So like I said before, unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving (and even then the highway better not be very busy), a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart.

I have an alternate solution to suggest: airline provided surgical masks to prevent airborne contamination and either thoroughly sanitized seating to prevent skin contact with oils left by previous passengers or, for those who don't feel secure in sanitization procedure, sealed cleanroom suits available upon request. A quick Google check turned up boxes of 50 medical grade surgical masks for $22, a company named Microarray selling individually sealed cleanroom suits with hood and boots for $27.45 each, and a 40 pack of latex gloves for $6. This provides a cheap and perfectly effective solution to what is, apparently, a very occasional problem. These masks and suits are considered safe enough to avoid contamination in the most sensitive of settings: operating rooms, high technology clean rooms, etc. They should be safe enough to avoid any chance of accidental inhalation or contact with peanut allergens. One thing I like about this as a solution is that it works equally well for all forms of airborne allergens, not just peanuts. What do you all think?

What is really telling in this entire discussion, is that each of the supposed allergy sufferers (or parents thereof) start off by saying I/my child has a life threatening allergy etc., and then describe an incident where they were exposed to the supposed allergen and either nothing happened, or a MILD reaction occurred.  Several times I see - 'I got nervous through  the whole flight because I could smell peanuts', or, 'he broke out in hives and I was terrified', or itchy eyes and scratchy throat, etc.  Not one of these posters is mentioning an actual serious reaction that led to death or extended hospitalization.  Hives, itchy eyes, scratchy throat - all unpleasant, but hardly life threatening.  If peanuts are so deadly, why aren't we hearing from ANYONE that has actually lost a loved one to them?  Could it be that the fear is illusory?  In a response to one of my earlier posts someone said that 100 to 200 people die of food allergies each year.  No citation or support is offered for this # so its accuracy can only be speculated.  The reply goes on to say 'the majority of those are caused by peanuts' - once again without citation.  Even if these #s were accurate, this is not a statistically significant portion of the population.  There is a huge gap here between perception and reality.  As Mr. Mulder correctly pointed out, when you are told over and over that peanuts will kill you, you may well have a reaction when you believe you have been exposed to them.  The problem is, it is a stress induced reaction (also called panic attack), NOT an allergy.  The fact is, numerous peer reviewed studies have found serious food allergies to be incredibly rare, and life threatening reactions to be so rare as to approach statistical ZERO.  The majority of self-reported allergics who have been actually studied do not react when given the supposed allergen in a controlled environment.    So, if actual science determines that there is a real risk to a statistically significant portion of the population, I will gladly surrender my peanuts.  The peanut people are correct about one thing, my enjoyment of a snack is not more important than actual lives.  The thing is, it has not been proved, has not even been reasonably implied that my peanuts are putting ANYONE at risk.

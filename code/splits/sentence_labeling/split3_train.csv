7	On a plane 2 years ago , when my son was 3 , he came into contact the carpeting below the seat and developed hives .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	2
8	We looked and saw an old peanut under the seat in front of us .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	3
9	He has a documented peanut allergy .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	4
10	I suspect that there was residual peanut in the carpet that he came into contact with .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	5
11	I am fairly certain that this 3 year-old boy he did not get hives because he was ' stressed out ' .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	6
12	Fortunately all he got was hives , but as best we could tell he did not have a serious ingestion ( and our leg of the flight was peanut-free after we had notified the airline of his allergy at booking and check-in ) .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	7
13	Please also see posts above citing the peer reviewed medical literature regarding the prevalence of food allergies , and specifically peanut allergies , in children .	0		peanuts759	8
14	So , while it is possible to have an IgE-mediated reaction solely from emotional stress , this was not the case here .	0		peanuts759	9
35	They are widely considered trailblazers in this regard exactly because they did go there and by doing so paved the way for other bands to do what they did , only more so .	1	1652.0	cmv229	10
36	Finally , there has never been a band that has had as big a cultural impact before and since .	0		cmv229	11
37	People would maybe argue Elvis in America , but I would personally put the Beatles above that .	0		cmv229	12
38	The simple fact that female fans would have genuine [ manic episodes ] ( just from seeing the Beatles ( something that did not happen before ) says a lot .	0		cmv229	13
39	I also did some research on the cultural impact the Beatles had on Liverpool and London , and it is remarkable . / / Along with that comes that , if you look purely at the quality of music that the Beatles produced you should be able to see that they have produced an enormous amount of arguably high quality music in a short time .	1	1653.0	cmv229	14
40	And the other bands know it too .	1	1654.0	cmv229	15
41	The Who stated they were highly influenced by the Beatles ( and the Beatles by them in return , just listen to [ Helter Skelter ] ( and I would argue that you can definitely hear some Beatles influences in both Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd , albeit more subtle .	1	1654.0	cmv229	16
42	They were way before their time in a way that no other band has been able to emulate , be it in musical quality , diversity of material , evolution , quality and volume of music produced in a short timespan , and mass appeal .	1	1654.0	cmv229	17
43	There has simply not been a band that has been able to deliver this complete package in the way that the Beatles did .	1	1654.0	cmv229	18
44	The main problem with this reasoning is that you're looking at the Beatles from our current perspective as opposed to looking at what they did from the perspective of someone who was around at the time .	0		cmv229	2
45	Other posters have discussed the technical advancements they ushered in , so instead I will try to explain the cultural impact they've had .	0		cmv229	3
46	When the Beatles entered the scene ( I wasn't around at the time , so this is taken from anecdotal evidence ) , much of the popular music was akin to what the Beatles released on Please Please Me , their first release .	1	1650.0	cmv229	4
47	It was practically unheard of ( at the time ) for artists to progress the way that the Beatles did .	1	1650.0	cmv229	5
48	Off the top of my head , I cannot think of a single artist that progressed as quick and as vast as they did in as little time , while still holding onto what made their music uniquely theirs .	1	1650.0	cmv229	6
49	There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both [ I Wanna Hold Your Hand ] ( and [ Tomorrow Never Knows ] ( very different songs , I admit , and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large ) in a way that is . . . natural .	1	1650.0	cmv229	7
50	They progressed as opposed to mutated .	1	1650.0	cmv229	8
51	Along with that comes the fact that bands like Radiohead would not have existed at the time ( that is to say , experimental bands that still achieved large mainstream appeal ) and would arguably never had achieved mainstream success or even existed were it not for the Beatles .	1	1651.0	cmv229	9
52	Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor , along with the janitor that was in basements burns . 4 .	1	1658.0	cmv201	10
53	Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene .	1	1658.0	cmv201	11
54	Im honestly not sure what to make of all this evidence , but something just strikes me as unsettling , and I see a lot of skeptics to whom I look up to ( Micheal Shermer , Bill Maher to a lesser degree , etc . ) dismissing the notion and Im not sure what Im overlooking that they arent .	0		cmv201	12
55	Im swearing into the Navy on Wednesday and this is the my biggest cause of apprehension about joining the war machine so hopefully one or more of you fine people can CMV !	0		cmv201	13

57	Thanks to those who responded , now I'll rejoin the ranks of the lurkers .	0		cmv201	15
58	EDIT #2 : So a SHIT TON of new comments over night , and sorry to say I cant address them individually , not that yall are craving my opinion , but I read them all and its good to note that other seemingly intelligent people shared my concerns and skepticism and I really enjoyed the healthy discourse below .	0		cmv201	16
59	Both sides have produced compelling arguments but after reassessing probability figures and relinquishing my right to observe evidence and draw my own conclusions due to my egregious lack of knowledge on the subject , the reality is that it would be insurmountably difficult to orchestrate something of this magnitude .	0		cmv201	17
60	I still think its a little fishy , but my common sense tells me thats probably due to authorities lack of a clear picture , not direct involvement and subsequent cover up .	0		cmv201	18
61	Thanks again for playing , hope to see you all again .	0		cmv201	19
62	I believe 9 / 11 was an inside job .	0		cmv201	2
63	EDIT #3 : here is a [ link ] ( to a post in / r / conspiracy detailing the arguments that cast doubt on the official story in much better detail than I had previously .	0		cmv201	20
64	Another redditor brought that to my attention and thought you guys may have a go at it .	0		cmv201	21
65	CMV Around my senior year of high school ( 2009 - ish ) I became quite interested in public events and foreign relations and wanted to become more knowledgeable about how the United States compared to the other nations without the star-spangled bias you get from public school and fox news .	1	1655.0	cmv201	3
66	Not too long after that I was exposed to 9 / 11 : In Plane Site as well as others , and the copious amounts of conspiracy videos of YouTube .	1	1655.0	cmv201	4
67	As someone of above average intelligence and a skeptic by nature I have never taken conspiracy theories too seriously , as many rely on sparse circumstantial evidence but for whatever reason this feels different .	1	1655.0	cmv201	5

71	The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns . 3 .	1	1658.0	cmv201	9
72	It wouldn't make either of us happy to cheapen that .	1	1663.0	cmv7	10
73	And ultimately , if people are happy being monogamous , who are you to tell them that they shouldn't be ?	1	1671.0	cmv7	11
74	Monogamy is meaningful to many people .	0		cmv7	2
75	It's a symbol of commitment to each other .	0		cmv7	3
76	I don't have sex with other people , not because my husband is controlling or possessive , but because I've promised not to have sex with anyone but him .	1	1660.0	cmv7	4
77	If I did and he got upset , it would be because I've broken that promise .	1	1661.0	cmv7	5
78	It would be the same in reverse .	1	1661.0	cmv7	6
79	Relationships are frequently about commitments to each other .	0		cmv7	7
80	It makes me happy that my husband and I have something so special that we don't share it with anyone else .	1	1662.0	cmv7	8
81	The fact that we don't have sex with other brings us closer together .	1	1662.0	cmv7	9
82	It's not a joking matter ; I would guess we have fewer complications because people with peanut issues don't fly .	1	1673.0	peanuts607	10
83	But this is a minority , and I would not support a ban on peanuts existing on an airplane .	0		peanuts607	11
84	but do we really need airlines to serve peanuts ?	0		peanuts607	12
85	This reaction isn't actually about peanuts at all .	0		peanuts607	13
86	Are we talking about airlines not providing peanuts , or peanuts not being allowed on an airplane ?	0		peanuts607	2
87	These are two VERY different issues .	0		peanuts607	3
88	I would be indifferent to rules preventing airlines from serving peanuts ( actually , I would welcome it , because I like the crackers better ! ) .	0		peanuts607	4
89	People who want peanuts can bring their own , easily enough .	0		peanuts607	5
90	Should people be banned from bringing their own peanuts ?	0		peanuts607	6
91	No .	0		peanuts607	7
92	And honestly , people would be more effective using market forces to convince airlines to change their menus .	0		peanuts607	8
93	I do have a cousin who legitimately goes into anaphylactic shock at exposure to peanuts .	1	1672.0	peanuts607	9
102	Raisins .	0		peanuts617	10
103	Whatever .	0		peanuts617	11
104	"It sounds like your "" awful "" experiences have not resulted in any allergic reactions ."	0		peanuts617	12
105	Bans on foods should be based exclusively on research .	0		peanuts617	13
106	Not on people feeling uncomfortable around certain foods .	0		peanuts617	14
107	Because if that's what regulations are based on , then there will soon be nothing served on any flight - and I don't think that's what anyone wants .	0		peanuts617	15
108	Again , I hope the DOT seriously considers actual research when making regulations .	0		peanuts617	16
109	I appreciate your circumstance .	0		peanuts617	2
110	But because you don't like the smell of nuts , we can't go instituting bans on foods .	0		peanuts617	3
111	I don't like the smell of fast food - does that mean there needs to be a ban on people bringing McD's on board ?	1	1676.0	peanuts617	4
112	As for food options , pack you own .	0		peanuts617	5
113	I do .	1	1677.0	peanuts617	6
114	I bring my own snacks .	1	1677.0	peanuts617	7
115	People with severe metabolic conditions like PKU travel with their own food .	0		peanuts617	8
116	Bring a bag of pretzels .	0		peanuts617	9
117	What a lot of people don't realize is that peanut allergies actually worsen as a person ages .	0		peanuts213	2
118	I have had a fatal peanut allergy all my life , and at age 28 , I found my throat swelling from the smell of peanut products .	1	1678.0	peanuts213	3
119	Also , EpiPens are great , but they DO NOT stop the reaction to all people .	1	1678.0	peanuts213	4
120	I carry two injections with me all the time , and those injections buy me an hour to get to a hospital for further treatment .	1	1678.0	peanuts213	5
121	Without a hospital and immediate follow-up care , I would continue in a reaction .	1	1683.0	peanuts213	6
122	TO CONGRESS : YES , it can happen , it does happen , it will continue to happen , and as I AM AFRAID TO FLY FOR THIS VERY REASON , I urge you to do something !	0		peanuts213	7
123	You cannot count on EpiPens to do everything !	0		peanuts213	8
124	I vote for banning all peanut products AND making an announcement , asking passengers to refrain from eating any peanut products they may have brought on board , if a passenger informs the airline about his / her allergy .	0		peanuts213	9
125	In Holland , no one is illegal until the procedure continues .	0		europolis9	2
126	As long as the procedure continues , those people are legally considered to be lawfully residents of the country ’ s territory .	0		europolis9	3
127	Those , living for 12 years in Holland , had lived there legally for those 12 years , so where is the problem ?	1	1684.0	europolis9	4
128	These people cannot do anything meanwhile .	0		europolis9	5
129	They cannot work , they have no right to own a house and very often they are practically forced to live on the street .	0		europolis9	6
130	I just wanted to add this , to specify it .	0		europolis9	7
131	During the snack a member of the flight crew pointed at us and told the other passengers that he could not offer them peanut M & Ms because there was an allergy sufferer on board .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	10
132	Thankfully , after a dose of benadryl my son was fine .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	11
133	I do think the passenger should come equipped with medication if case of exposure .	0		peanuts70	12
134	Most severe allergy suffers carry medicine with them anyway .	0		peanuts70	13
135	It would not hurt for the airline to carry addition medication because the epi-pen only allows 20 minutes to seek immediate medical attention .	0		peanuts70	14
136	I don't see the harm in banning at least the service of peanuts on the airlines .	0		peanuts70	2
137	The ban should include all peanut and peanut containing products .	0		peanuts70	3
138	Recently we flew across the country and followed all of the procedures the airline gave us in turn they promised to clean seats and create a buffer zone to sheild my 3 year old son from any peanut exposure .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	4
139	As I walked to me seat expecting what I was promised I find left over peanuts in our seats !	1	1686.0	peanuts70	5
140	I came prepared with wipes and medicine just in case .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	6
141	The airline offered no assistance in fixing the problem .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	7
142	After cleaning everything up and getting all settled in , I had to hold my son for the next 5 hours because it was too risky .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	8
143	At the onset of an attack the use of an epi-pen would give us about 20 minutes to be in a hospital .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	9
162	That takes care of that slippery slope .	0		peanuts1155	10
163	As a person that has been diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy , I believe there should be a ban on ALL foods .	1	1703.0	peanuts1155	2
164	A lot of people do not understand how severe peanut allergies can be and how long the medicine lasts .	0		peanuts1155	3
165	The medicine lasts around 10 - 15 min .	1	1708.0	peanuts1155	4
166	I usually carry 2 on my person when flying .	1	1706.0	peanuts1155	5
167	During one flight in 1999 , we had to make an emergency landing and I had to spend the night at the ER because of peanut dust circulating through the cabin .	1	1704.0	peanuts1155	6
168	I've read what other people have said about other allergies , and I say to ban all food items from being on planes ( with the exception of international flights and people with diabetes ) .	0		peanuts1155	7
169	You can live without peanuts or pretzels for food for 1 - 5 hours .	0		peanuts1155	8
170	Other people may die because some people can't consider that because they are being selfish .	0		peanuts1155	9
171	Mulder , I like peanuts , but I don't consider it my right to have airlines serve them to me .	1	1711.0	peanuts602	2
172	I don't think they need to .	1	1711.0	peanuts602	3
173	Plenty of times I'm not thrilled with what I am offered so I usually bring my own .	1	1710.0	peanuts602	4
174	I think some of this is just outrage that someone dare put a regulation on something .	0		peanuts602	5
175	But I don't think passengers should be banned from bringing peanut products on the flight .	0		peanuts602	6
176	There's a compromise that can be struck .	0		peanuts602	7
177	I wish I was on my home computer so I could browse my collection of contemporary art and show you some of my favourites .	1	1716.0	cmv199	10
178	For now , pick up an issue of Juxtapoz or Spectrum 21 to see the kind of cool things that are happening right now .	0		cmv199	11
179	Some I picked up just from a quick browse of Juxtapoz's website : [ David Mach's coat hanger sculpture ] ( [ Chiharu Shiota's installations ] ( and [ Stephanie Clark's embrodiery ] ( It's worth pointing out a lot of contemporary artists are now doing things on larger scales or with materials that cannot be properly represented online ( eg video , the texture of string , illusions that can only be felt from a certain perspective in the room ) .	1	1717.0	cmv199	12
180	If you're not regularly setting foot in galleries , you're missing a lot of great stuff .	0		cmv199	13
181	please .	0		cmv199	2
182	I work in an art gallery .	1	1713.0	cmv199	3
183	You'd be amazed at how much crap there is pre - 1950s that manages to survive .	1	1714.0	cmv199	4
184	"There were big trends of "" artists "" who pre-painted torsos and then hastily painted their client's heads on top , because it was a quick way for the average joe to make some decent money without much talent ."	1	1715.0	cmv199	5
185	Half of these guys didn't even bother painting a coherent hand .	1	1715.0	cmv199	6
186	There will always be amateurs , con artists , and plain art you don't like screwing up what you would otherwise consider a great era .	0		cmv199	7
187	Also , you seem to have an issue with 1970s abstract expressionism and are using it to represent all contemporary art .	0		cmv199	8
188	There is a lot of fantastic stuff out there today , but as with all kinds of creations , most of it will be crap or stuff you don't like .	0		cmv199	9
189	Thankfully that type of exposure is not life threatening ( at least not yet ) but the concern is very real .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	10
190	I am not a child , I am not traveling for pleasure and I don't have the power of completely removing something that can be life threatening for me while at work so I do the best I can to continue safely performing my duties as an airline pilot .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	11
191	I support the ban for airlines not to serve bagged peanut products and support the requirement that a public address announcement be made for those that have brought their own on board refrain from consuming them .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	12
192	When traveling in the cabin , I am always aware of those around me and what they are consuming .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	13
193	I have come to find that my sensitivity is mostly a distance of 1 row forward and back and two seats laterally ( about 5 - 6 feet ) .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	14
194	If I can detect the odor of peanuts then I become concerned .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	15
195	In case you were wondering , yes I do carry an epinephrine auto injector ( never used one ) , Allegra and antihistamine eye drops .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	16
196	Not having peanuts served during a flight would be of great benefit for me and other allergy sufferers .	0		peanuts400	17
197	As a side note , commercial grade , not cold pressed , peanut oil is fine for most peanut allergy sufferers .	0		peanuts400	18
198	The process of extracting the oil leaves none of the offending protein .	0		peanuts400	19
199	I could not be happier if airlines discontinue serving peanuts on flights .	0		peanuts400	2
200	I have consumed many products prepared with peanut oil , albeit with great trepidation , and have not had any adverse reactions .	1	1721.0	peanuts400	20
201	As a life long peanut allergy sufferer , I have always held out hope that airlines would recognize that they are providing their passengers with the #1 food allergy product .	0		peanuts400	3
202	I have seen many arguments that they should be banned in restaurants , ballparks etc . , however , those venues are completely voluntary ( establishments that promote / provide peanuts that are shelled and thrown on the floor do not get my business ) but airline travel is a closed quarters , necessity for many people .	0		peanuts400	4
203	I , for one , have to contend with residue and airborne particulate from those little bags of roasted peanuts served on aircraft almost on a daily basis since I am an airline Captain .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	5
204	For 22 years I have been meticulous with keeping my work environment ( flight deck ) safe for me by not consuming items that may contain peanuts , avoiding touching my eyes and asking my co-pilot not to consume bagged peanuts ( other peanut products that don't risk going airborne are usually ok ) .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	6
205	Unfortunately , my ability to control my environment becomes more difficult when I am assigned a reposition flight and must ride as a passenger .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	7
206	I advise the flight attendants and hope they remember .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	8
207	I have suffered mild / moderate anaphyalactic and asthmatic distress if I am unaware that someone opened a bag of peanuts .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	9
208	I would argue the contrary : Humans are benevolent and social creatures , that are very capable of violence .	0		cmv172	10
209	Think about it .	0		cmv172	11
210	You are less likely to die of violence today , than ever before , why ?	0		cmv172	12
211	Because we built our societies in ways that prevent violence more and more .	1	1732.0	cmv172	13
212	Are we having setbacks ?	1	1732.0	cmv172	14
213	Of course !	1	1732.0	cmv172	15
214	Thousands of years ago , we had to use a lot more violence to survive .	1	1732.0	cmv172	16
215	Hunt animals down and kill them , defend them against other humans ( not brutal humans , * hungry * humans ) .	1	1732.0	cmv172	17
216	But we always made our best efforts , to make everything safer and safer .	1	1732.0	cmv172	18
217	We rebuilt and tried to make it better .	1	1732.0	cmv172	19
218	I have thought * * a lot * * about this topic .	1	1729.0	cmv172	2
219	And can you argue against the fact , that we have the most comfortable live ( on average ) today , than any generation before us ?	0		cmv172	20
220	Why ?	0		cmv172	21
221	Because we are brutal and uncivilzed ?	0		cmv172	22
222	That does not make sense .	0		cmv172	23
223	I live in germany , so by default I have been confronted with the topic in school many times .	1	1729.0	cmv172	3
224	History was my strongest class .	1	1729.0	cmv172	4

230	It is a scientifically proven fact that anaphylaxis exists and can kill after peanut exposure .	0		peanuts364	10
231	Someone above likened this to the Boogey Man , but if I give my son a peanut , he could die ( and almost has ) ; everytime I look under his bed for the Boogey Man , there's nothing .	1	1738.0	peanuts364	11
232	It's pretty reliable data .	0		peanuts364	12
233	Let life and death be the standard for what foods to ban , and no one should have a problem with this issue .	0		peanuts364	13
234	I didn't know that there was a sizable peanut lobby , nor that so many Americans tie their rights , freedom , and understanding of Capitalism to their ability to eat peanuts .	0		peanuts364	14
235	But I've always known that they love to tie their prejudices to matters they don't understand , and this board is proof of the reason WHY the government resorts to making laws that should be common sense and decency .	0		peanuts364	15

237	For some people ( my son ) the life-threatening reaction of airway constriction is immediate .	1	1737.0	peanuts364	3
238	I couldn't carry enough Epi-pens to allow the plane time enough to land so that we could get to an ER where a doctor - - not a nurse - - could save his life .	1	1737.0	peanuts364	4
239	I'm not an expert like you , but last I heard death by suffocation takes a mere 9 minutes .	0		peanuts364	5
240	It would be good business for the airlines to voluntarily do everything they can to avoid re-directing aircraft due to an emergency and ruining everyone's very important trip to Cancun .	0		peanuts364	6

481	Because of that , I know that reactions to airborne peanut particles are real and it raises concerns for me about what happens in the small , enclosed environment of an airplane .	1	1859.0	peanuts670	4

964	I chose the flight , taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy .	1	2064.0	peanuts480	18
965	"They created a "" peanut-free zone "" around me , serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me ."	1	2064.0	peanuts480	19
966	I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now , and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban .	0		peanuts480	2
967	I still had a mild reaction ( no use of the EpiPen , in other words , but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane ) , so that when I did arrive at the hospital , I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one .	1	2064.0	peanuts480	20
968	Towards the end of graduate school , I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them .	1	2065.0	peanuts480	21
969	For offices that were far away , I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city .	1	2065.0	peanuts480	22
970	I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air , but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication .	1	2065.0	peanuts480	23
971	I've had allergies since the age of 2 , so I understand that sometimes , my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others .	1	2068.0	peanuts480	24
972	But when I take all necessary precautions and still , my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one , because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts , isn't that a little ridiculous ?	1	2068.0	peanuts480	25

978	The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights .	0		peanuts480	30

984	And I've always had various other medications - e.g . inhaler - on hand .	1	2063.0	peanuts480	9
985	This is not a matter of itchy eyes or a runny nose .	1	2077.0	peanuts655	2

1245	EDIT2 : Hey all this post generated a ton of great discussion and showed me a lot of ways that my view lacked nuance .	0		cmv293	9
1254	The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved * * significantly * * less stopping than the average driver makes .	1	2187.0	cmv46	10
1255	At steady speed highway driving , you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size / efficiency combustion engines because it is simple physics .	0		cmv46	11
1256	What you don't seem to be taking into account ( or at least understating the importance of ) is regenerative braking . 100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking .	0		cmv46	12
1257	Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [ as much as 50% ] ( of that energy .	0		cmv46	13
1258	For the sake of keeping things honest , let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient .	0		cmv46	14
1259	See the importance of regenerative braking ?	0		cmv46	15
1260	Using Newton's 2nd law , we can estimate that to get up to speed , Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy ( and fuel ) than Non-Hybrid X , but then when they both stop , Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses .	0		cmv46	16
1261	This is especially important because vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed ( Newton's 1st law ) .	0		cmv46	17
1262	Yes , weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road , but the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all .	0		cmv46	18
1263	So to summarize : Driving at a steady speed - slightly better fuel economy for non-Hybrids .	0		cmv46	19
1264	& gt ; 1 - In order to function , a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries , a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components ( eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking ) .	0		cmv46	2
1265	Driving with braking - significantly better fuel economy for Hybrids .	0		cmv46	20
1266	So like I said before , unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving ( and even then the highway better not be very busy ) , a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart .	0		cmv46	21
1267	[ According to the Prius wiki ] ( the battery pack weighs 118 lbs .	0		cmv46	3
1268	Since I can't find a figure online , let's say the electric motor components ( which are the major components for regenerative braking ) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing .	0		cmv46	4
1269	So 218 pounds out of a total of around [ 2900 lb curb weight ] ( puts ~ 7.5% more weight onto the vehicle .	0		cmv46	5
1270	Not as much as one might think .	0		cmv46	6
1271	( It's also the weight of a full grown adult , so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo .	0		cmv46	7
1272	Yes , that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy but it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking .	0		cmv46	8
1273	& gt ; It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius , and completely remove all of the electrical components , it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid .	1	2187.0	cmv46	9
1274	I originally had this posted in another section , but it seems more appropriate here .	1	2188.0	peanuts657	2
1275	I have an alternate solution to suggest : airline provided surgical masks to prevent airborne contamination and either thoroughly sanitized seating to prevent skin contact with oils left by previous passengers or , for those who don't feel secure in sanitization procedure , sealed cleanroom suits available upon request .	0		peanuts657	3
1276	A quick Google check turned up boxes of 50 medical grade surgical masks for $22 , a company named Microarray selling individually sealed cleanroom suits with hood and boots for $27.45 each , and a 40 pack of latex gloves for $6 .	0		peanuts657	4
1277	This provides a cheap and perfectly effective solution to what is , apparently , a very occasional problem .	0		peanuts657	5
1278	These masks and suits are considered safe enough to avoid contamination in the most sensitive of settings : operating rooms , high technology clean rooms , etc .	0		peanuts657	6
1279	They should be safe enough to avoid any chance of accidental inhalation or contact with peanut allergens .	0		peanuts657	7

1771	Edit : Great discussion everyone !	0		cmv9	13
1772	Thanks for all your input !	0		cmv9	14
1773	I think cyberbullying is BS , CMV Like a lot of people , I was bullied all through school .	1	2406.0	cmv9	2
1774	I understand that all of us are raised differently and not all of us are given the tools to deal with situations like these .	0		cmv9	3
1775	I just don't think babying the kids is fixing it .	0		cmv9	4
1776	"It allows them to be a "" victim "" ."	0		cmv9	5
1777	I know they are victim's but I mean in the sense of that's the tools we are giving them to respond .	0		cmv9	6
1778	Aside from that , cyberbullying is even more BS .	0		cmv9	7
1779	"Maybe I'm just stuck comparing my experience to the fact that the internet is not a "" nice "" place ."	0		cmv9	8
1780	It just seems silly to think that when you add anonymity people won't be more cruel .	0		cmv9	9
1781	If so , they should notify the flight attendant and some sort of seating rearrangement will occur in a way to maximize safety and minimize inconvenience .	0		peanuts741	10
1782	This will require flexibility and generosity of spirit on the part of all people involved ( and I do recognize is likely to be annoying ) but , in truth , is not that big of a deal when compared to a significant safety issue .	0		peanuts741	11
1783	The other factor here is that I am , in truth , less worried about a nearby PBJ sandwich or a Snickers bar than I am about a bag of raw peanuts as these foods are less likely to have particles that go airborne .	1	2413.0	peanuts741	12
1784	It does not mean that I am unconcerned but just that they pose less risk .	1	2413.0	peanuts741	13
1785	Finally , if necessary , I am more than prepared to either 1 ) give an affected passenger food that we brought on the plane that is peanut safe if they are really hungry ( we always bring plenty of extra ' safe ' food ) or will gladly fork over the additional $5 - $50 to buy them / their family whatever in-flight food they want if it means that they will not expose my family to peanut allergens in close proximity .	1	2411.0	peanuts741	14
1786	Thanks .	0		peanuts741	15
1787	I agree with Steyermark's comments in many ways - a full ban on peanut products is unenforceable and not practical .	0		peanuts741	2
1788	In my family , we read labels , understand where the labels may not give all of the information , etc . . .	1	2412.0	peanuts741	3
1789	This is not something that will be done by the majority of people .	1	2412.0	peanuts741	4
1790	Also , foods like PBJ sandwiches are really easy to fly with - no refrigeration required .	0		peanuts741	5
1791	So , what I think needs to happen : 1 ) The airlines themselves do not serve peanut products 2 ) The airlines have clearly documented / posted allergy policies with education of staff ( and encouragement of passenger awareness of these policies ) to increase awareness that there may need to be some seat flexibility for people intending to eat peanut products from home during the flight if seated near peanut-allergic individuals .	0		peanuts741	6
1792	A key reason for this is that people deal with change better when it is expected , so if there is education in advance regarding these policies and issues , then seat changes or similar interventions are more likely to go smoothly .	0		peanuts741	7
1793	Overall , I can foresee that this may be a bit inconvenient and people affected may find this to be an annoyance , but , in the grand scheme of things , this is not that big of a deal .	0		peanuts741	8
1794	A policy could consist of identifying those in close proximity to the peanut-allergic individual and giving them a handout that asks if they have peanut products that they are going to be eating .	0		peanuts741	9
1795	The few times we have flown , she invariably sneezes , scratches , and breaks out in hives ; a far cry from anaphylaxis ( which she has experienced , unfortunately ) , but still a real possibility that keeps us on edge throughout the entire flight .	1	2418.0	peanuts782	10
1796	We do carry EpiPens and Benadryl everywhere we go , but for those who think having medication on hand in case of an allergic reaction is analogous to having spare Pampers on hand to change to dirty diaper , you are incredibly out of touch with reality , uninformed on the issue , or both .	1	2418.0	peanuts782	11
1797	"For anyone to maintain that their hunger "" satisfaction "" from a 100 - calorie bag of peanuts is more important than the safety and / or life of a human being is blatantly insensitive and ignorant ."	0		peanuts782	12

1800	While a study on the effect airborne peanut dust in an aircraft has on people with peanut allergies is important , legislators should not solely rely on such a study when considering a peanut ban on aircrafts .	0		peanuts782	2
1801	Other sources of peanut exposure on aircraft are also a large problem .	0		peanuts782	3
1802	Crumbs , peanut / peanut butter residue , and whole peanuts are regularly found on seats , in seat back pockets , on floors , and on tray tables from previous flights despite flight attendants ' and cleaning crews ' best efforts to clean the cabin .	1	2420.0	peanuts782	4
1803	My 4 - year old daughter has a severe peanut allergy in addition to other food allergies not in consideration for this bill .	1	2418.0	peanuts782	5
1804	We limit our flying to destinations beyond a 13 - hour drive by car .	1	2418.0	peanuts782	6
1805	We try to fly peanut-allergy-friendly airlines when it is not cost prohibitive .	1	2418.0	peanuts782	7
1806	When we do board an aircraft , we use baby wipes to clean our entire row of seats , seat belts , tray tables , and the seat back in front of us to remove peanut dust and residue .	1	2418.0	peanuts782	8
1807	In spite of our best efforts to minimize allergen exposure to our daughter , flying is still a very stressful event .	1	2418.0	peanuts782	9
1808	I have sympathy for those with peanut allergies , but banning peanuts from flights via a DOT regulation seems to go too far .	1	2424.0	peanuts219	2
1809	Perhaps advocacy groups for those who are peanut-allergic will approach the major carriers to voluntarily set aside seating blocks that are reserved for allergy sufferers , and non-sufferers who are willing to agree not to eat peanuts while sitting in that particular block .	0		peanuts219	3
1810	"As someone who suffers from a medical condition which requires me to carry my "" rescue "" medication with me everywhere I go , I think that if the risk to an allergy sufferer is deemed to be significant , then they should ( a ) consider alternate travel methods other than flying , ( b ) ensure they have sufficient "" rescue "" medication to last the entire time they might be stuck in an aircraft , and ( c ) they should wear appropriate clothing / face masks to minimize exposed skin and inhalation risk ."	1	2423.0	peanuts219	4

1816	I mean wtf they are just shiny hard pieces of carbon , I mean hell so is my ass .	0		cmv226	14
1817	So why are they so expensive ?	0		cmv226	15
1818	It ’ s because of the art and skill it takes to cut a polish a rough diamond .	0		cmv226	16
1819	These are skilled professionals who take years of training and experience to cut a rough diamond and actually make it look fantastic .	1	2430.0	cmv226	17

1822	This is pretty much the way I thought for a long time until I got my fiancée an engagement ring .	1	2426.0	cmv226	2

1831	Now you still may not like a mined diamond who knows maybe the store or website is lying and it is a blood diamond .	0		cmv226	28
1832	I considered buying a synthetic diamond from a place like [ here ] ( They use large pressure cookers to form real diamonds which are a little less expensive .	1	2432.0	cmv226	29
1833	After doing lots of research I am extremely happy with my purchase of a diamond engagement ring .	1	2426.0	cmv226	3
1834	I didn ’ t buy from them because they didn ’ t have the shape and style I was looking for and they aren ’ t that great at producing pure colorless yet .	1	2432.0	cmv226	30
1835	But they appear to be getting better and better .	0		cmv226	31
1836	Of course they are about the same price for freaking carbon , but that ’ s because these diamonds still need to be cut by the same artists who cut earth-grown diamonds .	0		cmv226	32
1837	Furthermore you could argue that the technology needed to make these is an art in itself . 5 ) You get enjoyment researching and every day she wears it .	0		cmv226	33
1838	Finally it was fun looking all this up knowing that she will wear what I pick every single day .	1	2427.0	cmv226	34
1839	Sometimes I see the sparkle of the facet pattern when we are out at a restaurant and think of how I may know the facet pattern better than she does ; I know why I chose a “ modified brilliant cut ” over an “ old mine cut ” and how it suits her and her personality .	1	2427.0	cmv226	35
1840	Sometimes while driving her I see some shimmer on the celling of the car and think about what that means ; this stone , this diamond , on my fiancée ’ s finger , grew in the earth for perhaps millions of years at 1800 degrees to one day be blasted out of the earth through a volcano , to then be found , mined , cut , polished and finally purchased by me and given to my fiancée .	1	2427.0	cmv226	36
1841	Sometimes while on the couch with her , I see some reflection on the wall and I think of the sacrifice it took to mine , produce , and ship and the cost to me and I think that she is worth it .	1	2427.0	cmv226	37
1842	You get to be reminded almost every day what this person means to you and at $0.27 a day it ’ s a steal .	1	2427.0	cmv226	38
1843	There are several reasons why to buy a diamond 1 ) The cartel has broken .	0		cmv226	4

1845	They aren't rare , they are just strategically kept out of the market . ”	0		cmv226	6
1846	While that still is true to a certain extent the big cartel player ( De Beers ) has finally been broken .	0		cmv226	7
1847	In 2000 producers in Russia , Canada and Australia decided to cut off channels to De Beers due to the negative publicity of “ blood diamonds ” and De Beers has been losing market share .	1	2429.0	cmv226	8

2202	There are some famous arguments , however , that try and show that this cannot be so .	0		cmv238	29
2203	The * experience * of the color red .	1	190.0	cmv238	3
2204	One such is the [ knowledge argument ] ( Here is one form by Frank Jackson : & gt ; Mary is a brilliant scientist who is , for whatever reason , forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor .	1	187.0	cmv238	30
2205	She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires , let us suppose , all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes , or the sky , and use terms like ‘ red ’ , ‘ blue ’ , and so on .	1	187.0	cmv238	31
2206	She discovers , for example , just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina , and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence ‘ The sky is blue ’ .

2403	Every time you choose to pee with the seat up , you're forcing the next occupant of that loo ( if female ) to put the seat back down .	1	319.0	cmv103	10
2404	However , the reverse is not true ; if a woman leaves the seat down , you are presented with a choice - lift it and pee standing up , or keep it down and sit ( or risky option number three , pee through the reduced-area target of a down seat ) .	1	319.0	cmv103	11
2405	It's not about empowerment or perpetuating inequality , it's about recognising that the privelege of choice is yours , not theirs - so don't be a dick .	0		cmv103	12
2406	Another way to think about it - a house of 2 men will need to lift and lower the seat depending on their preferences and due to the fact that you can't poop standing up ( unless you're incredibly talented ) .	1	325.0	cmv103	13
2407	A house of 2 women will never lift the seat .	1	325.0	cmv103	14
2408	So if you moved each of those people into a house together , the rule ' leave the seat down when you're done ' means nobody has to change their seat awareness - the men have to raise or lower it from time to time , and are aware of that , but the women do not .	1	326.0	cmv103	15
2409	Which seems , to me , to be the most fair way of doing it .	0		cmv103	16
2410	I recently changed my own view on this from yours to the view that actually , I should put the seat down .	1	320.0	cmv103	2
2411	My thinking was this : Men can choose to stand , or to sit .	0		cmv103	3
2412	Both valid options , though many men would tell you ( due to some ridiculous idea about ' masculinity ' or something ) that it's standing only as a guy .	1	327.0	cmv103	4
2413	You can stand or sit .	0		cmv103	5
2414	Sometimes , I choose to sit - it certainly minimises the risk of a disobedient member blasting the rim with piss .	1	317.0	cmv103	6
2415	Women don't have that choice .	0		cmv103	7

2418	I do not think the same can be said of a non-STEM major switching into engineering .	1	334.0	cmv129	10

2433	Please CMV * * Edit 3 : * * Thanks everyone !	0		cmv129	4
2434	I have had my view changed mostly due to these arguments : ( 1 ) that grading is different between STEM and non-STEM with maybe a bit more leniency outside the hard sciences ( 2 ) My school is far from representative of everywhere despite being a large mid-tier institution and ( 3 ) Philosophy is hard when you dig deep enough .	1	332.0	cmv129	5
2435	I honestly would like someone to change my view in regard to this because I totally believe that the academic elitist view of many engineers ( myself included ) is justified based on the difficulty of my classes .	0		cmv129	6
2436	I haven't heard much of the same from other STEM majors but I think at this point it's a justified view for them as well .	0		cmv129	7
2437	Basically , my view boils down to this : After having taken a number of upper-level social science courses as required non-tech electives ( some economics , psychology , philosophy ) , it is my opinion that non-STEM majors ( excluding skill-based arts / music ) are much easier and in general require less work to get the same grade .	1	328.0	cmv129	8
2438	If I were to decide to major in a non-STEM major I think I could be just as if not more successful than nearly everyone in these majors if I wanted to pursue one of them instead .	1	329.0	cmv129	9

2478	I'm a tennis player so I'm going to use that as an analogy .	1	356.0	cmv289	2
2479	In tennis , we often times practice new techniques with slow , hand-fed balls .	1	356.0	cmv289	3
2480	A coach will stand close and toss a ball easily up for us to hit .	1	356.0	cmv289	4
2481	This gives the player additional time to process and understand their technique .	1	356.0	cmv289	5
2482	For instance , if I were to learn a forehand from scratch I wouldn't want to go out and just start hitting it .	1	357.0	cmv289	6

2494	In my opinion , Holland has a problem with the legal system as it is not strict – weak , I would say .	0		europolis22	4
2495	So one should consider what to do in order to improve this system and make it more efficient .	0		europolis22	5
2496	If there were some sanctions , or punishments for these or other actions .	0		europolis22	6
2497	When that murder was committed , I think everyone knows it was in Holland , everyone could see that the legal system was not able to impose an appropriate punishment for the guilty .	1	367.0	europolis22	7
2498	So a jurisdiction should be developed , to be more strict .	0		europolis22	8
2499	And I also believe that those fanatics should feel that sanctions could be imposed on them .	0		europolis22	9

2516	I believe that cheating is acceptable in the high stress environment that students are placed in today because of higher requirements for entry to college and more and more pressure from society .	0		cmv266	2
2517	CMV I am a senior in high school , and while I dont cheat , I can see why people do it and I don't really have a problem with it .	1	382.0	cmv266	3
2518	I live in California , and the kids at my school take 5 - 6 AP classes junior year and senior year .	1	382.0	cmv266	4
2519	They pay large amounts of money for SAT prep classes , and other resources like this .	1	382.0	cmv266	5
2520	When every kid at your school is so far ahead , an average student who works hard to get B's is left behind and can't keep up .	1	383.0	cmv266	6
2521	So they might resort to cheating to keep up with them .	1	383.0	cmv266	7
2522	And I feel that this is justified because it can be really unfair for those who work their asses off to get that B , only to have their application to a better college rejected because people keep pushing this envelope of cramming more and more AP classes into their schedule .	1	388.0	cmv266	8
2523	So when it comes down to it in my opinion , when someone's hardest and best effort wont get them somewhere because of the unfair competition they face , cheating is justified . thanks in advance for your replies !	0		cmv266	9

2539	In fact , some of them assimilate themselves and were normally taking part in classes , they were also my neighbours , but there was something that scared me a lot in their culture .	1	394.0	europolis32	4
2540	For example , at the beach we could see a man without any clothes and his wife fully dressed up , sweaty and she couldn ’ t show her face .	1	395.0	europolis32	5

2712	As the father of a three year old daughter who was recently diagnosed with a life-threatening peanut allergy , I fully support a ban on peanuts and food containing peanuts .	1	483.0	peanuts298	2
2713	While my daughter does not have an inhalation allergy , she is extremely sensitive and if she ingested even a minute particle of peanut protein , she could have a life threatening reaction .	1	483.0	peanuts298	3
2714	While we have epi pens and benadryl to administer in the event of such an event , those medications are only a short term response and immediate medical care is essential .	1	483.0	peanuts298	4
2715	As a parent , it is my job to insure she does not ingest anything that will cause a reaction and we do everything we can to create a large buffer between her and such products .	1	487.0	peanuts298	5
2716	That said , we have little control over the environment in an airplane .	1	488.0	peanuts298	6
2717	Others eating peanuts nearby or even someone having eaten a peanut on an earlier flight could create a very real problem .	1	484.0	peanuts298	7

2877	Well said .	0		peanuts283	2
2878	Last time i saw a statisic on food allergy fatalities it was aobut 100 to 150 over a five year period for all foods .	1	570.0	peanuts283	20
2879	This is not to say that peanut and tree nut allergies , or any allergy is not serious .	0		peanuts283	21
2880	They are .	0		peanuts283	22
2881	But I wonder if these same parents who are demandting that peanuts and tree nuts be banned from everywhere are asking for sports be eliminated from school programs , or if their children are being kept out of sports . or , have they given up driving their children in a car ; or , will they get their son or daughter a drivers license at age 16 .	0		peanuts283	23
2882	i have a friend whose child almost died twice from a serious allergy to milk because people think milk allergy can't be fatal ; they confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance because the hysteria created by some about peanut has drowned out any sense of reason and overshadowed everyone else's issues .	1	564.0	peanuts283	24
2883	A recent widely publicized study showed that far more people think they have food allergies than actually do .	0		peanuts283	25
2884	Again , i am not minimizing those who do , but a food allergy needs to be diagnosed by a certified immunologist who conducts a food challenge .	0		peanuts283	26
2885	Then and only then does a patient really know what they are allergic to . and , a food allergy is very different than a food sensitivity .	0		peanuts283	27
2886	Many people have multiple food allergies , but once properly diagnosed that person needs to be taught to care for themselves and take all necessary precautions .	0		peanuts283	28
2887	Also , I read in the news is that patients with egg and food allergy have now been de-sensitized in clinical settings with guess what ?	0		peanuts283	29
2888	I fly extensively in the US and internationally .	1	563.0	peanuts283	3
2889	egg and peanut !	0		peanuts283	30
2890	so , let's rid ourselves of the hysteria .	0		peanuts283	31
2891	let's stop our demanding and outrageousness and let's call for ome common sense .	0		peanuts283	32
2892	"i fear for these children that are being raised by parents to live in fear of the "" bogey man "" ."	0		peanuts283	33
2893	instead of teaching them to handle whatever afflication they have in a responsible and calm manner - - whether it's severe asthma , other food allergies , diabetes , cystic fibrosis , and the hundreds of other afflications that so many of us live with everyday .	0		peanuts283	34
2894	I myself have a food allergy so i truly understand what it takes to be vigliant ; it isn't easy .	1	565.0	peanuts283	35
2895	in all my years of flying and with all the different carriers i have been on , i find that whether in the US or abroad , without legislation , they try to be as accommodating as possible when people plan ahead and are not behaving rudely .	1	566.0	peanuts283	36
2896	we have more than enough regulation and every time a new regulation comes along it always carries unintended consequences .	1	572.0	peanuts283	37
2897	so , once you ban peanuts and tree nuts , will you prohibit seeing eye dogs on flights for those of us who are severly allergic ?	1	572.0	peanuts283	38
2898	Remember , you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal . or , will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier , check on your medications , where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions .	1	572.0	peanuts283	39
2899	And , in reading all the comments posted thus far , for the most part , there appears to be a lot of emotion and not a lot of facts surrounding this issue .	0		peanuts283	4
2900	My own near fatal experience to a different allergy reinforced for me that if you demand the world conform to you , you will become lax making it more likely you will have an accidenta encounter .	1	567.0	peanuts283	40
2901	we need to be prepared and proactive , not create a bubble around ourselves and our children .	0		peanuts283	41

2906	Some facts to consider .	0		peanuts283	9
2909	If you've ever seen images of fabric through a microscope you'll understand why it takes such force to dislodge captured particulates .	0		peanuts651	10
2910	I'm not sure why you continue to question the potential severity of peanut allergies .	0		peanuts651	11
2911	There's a very large body of medical documentation establishing , quite thoroughly , just how severe these allergies can be and others on this site have mentioned that nut allergies account for the majority of food-allergy caused death .	1	579.0	peanuts651	12
2912	Whether or not anyone on an airplane has died from this , YET , is irrelevant .	0		peanuts651	13
2913	"If you could go back to August 2001 , knowing what you know now , how would you feel about people who argued against increasing airport security by saying "" well nobody has ever crashed a plane into a building , so we shouldn't take precautions against it "" ?"	1	580.0	peanuts651	14
2914	Perhaps we've just been lucky so far .	1	580.0	peanuts651	15
2915	From what I've gathered reading the comments here , people with peanut allergies severe enough to warrant immediate medical attention , because of their fears , do not generally fly on airplanes .	0		peanuts651	16
2916	Very small population to begin with + widespread self-imposed flying ban = No deaths , YET , on an airplane .	0		peanuts651	17
2917	However , the whole point of the ADA is to ensure that Americans with disabilities do not HAVE to forgo things such as flight because of their disability .	0		peanuts651	18
2918	The problem , right now , isn't people dying of anaphylaxis on airplanes , it's American citizens being unable , because of their disability , to participate in a normal , every day activity that they otherwise would be able to , with minor accommodation .	0		peanuts651	19
2919	Try a Google search .	0		peanuts651	2
2920	I do agree with you that banning peanuts ( and , really , all nuts ) on flights is not the right way to go .	0		peanuts651	20
2921	Instead of worrying about one particular person and what motivation they may or may not have had in ignoring your first recommendation of it , why not help the overall cause here by continuing to advocate that airlines provide , upon request , masks , gloves , and cleanroom suits so that those who DO take responsibility for their own condition can enjoy the freedom air travel provides the rest of us US citizens .	0		peanuts651	21
2922	I very quickly found a link to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America that contends that under both the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 that allergies and asthma are both recognized disabilities .	0		peanuts651	3
2923	"Again , "" breathing "" is defined as a "" major life function "" and it's pretty hard to argue that completely closed airways through anaphylaxis do not constitute a "" substantial limiting "" ."	0		peanuts651	4
2924	Whether or not the federal government has specifically ruled on this , I don't know .	0		peanuts651	5
2925	Did you find any court rulings opposed to this position ?	0		peanuts651	6
2926	If the courts simply haven't addressed this yet , which , frankly , seems unlikely considering how many organizations and websites I've found that reference successful cases of workplace discrimination under the ADA for individuals with allergies , the fact is , when they do , they almost certainly will ( or at least should ) recognize this as a conditional disability qualifying under the ADA for the reasons above .	0		peanuts651	7
2927	As I understand it , the concern is not over trace amounts of oil and dust that have been absorbed or trapped by fabric , it's over the clouds of fresh dust that are released when a package is opened and dispersed throughout the plane via the central air system or from the overhead air jets .	0		peanuts651	8
2928	The oils in the fabric will most likely have been absorbed down below the surface level and the dust trapped by the fabric is unlikely to be dislodged in significant quantities short of someone actively beating the seats as one would a rug .	0		peanuts651	9

2932	I HAVE to be able to opt out of organ donation , because my conditions are not things doctors would test a transplant organ for , normally .	1	581.0	cmv97	5
2933	Unless I grow sick , have to stay in the hospital a while , and then die , the doctors wouldn't know , and they would kill someone with my organs .	1	581.0	cmv97	6
2934	[ Mainly with my blood ] If I got in a car accident for example , and was pronounced dead at the scene , but the other person needed a kidney ASAP , what doctor wouldn't want to put my kidney in them ?	1	581.0	cmv97	7
2935	It LOOKS healthy .	1	581.0	cmv97	8
2936	Opting out is my way of preventing people from dying .	0		cmv97	9
2937	It's absolutely integral to my identity .	1	588.0	cmv109	10
2938	If I were to put on a dress it wouldn't tap into some female part of me because of some ridiculous notion of gender roles , I would just be a really uncomfortable man in a dress .	1	589.0	cmv109	11
2939	On to your point about how we are perceived in society : you have never known societal discomfort until you have lived a day with Gender Dysphoria .	1	590.0	cmv109	12
2940	Hearing ' ma'am ' or ' miss ' all day every day is the kind of thing that can just make you want to lay down and die as a transgender person .	1	590.0	cmv109	13
2941	It may seem shallow and unnecessary to pander to what society expects of us but there are two reasons for it : one is that stereotypes are absolutely based in fact—they are really just a variation on what psychologists call ' schemas ' or really quick bullet points about something that your brain can pull out at the mention of a word .	0		cmv109	14
2942	Basically all those little pictures we get in our mind when someone says ' little old lady ' or ' Scotsman ' .	1	602.0	cmv109	15
2943	The reason these exist is that they are based on truth and are your brain's way of saving a bit of time because memorising each individual aspect of each individual little old lady or Scotsman you meet is a daunting task .	1	595.0	cmv109	16
2944	These are only detrimental if we grow to rely on them too much and don't allow them to adapt or expect everyone to fit accurately into our schema which will accurately describe only a handful of people .	1	596.0	cmv109	17
2945	So basically gender roles are a schema : girls do this , boys do that .	0		cmv109	18
2946	My little notecards in my noggin say so—and they are absolutely accurate as a * generalisation * which is why you will find that many trans people do fit these stereotypes of their true gender well .	1	597.0	cmv109	19
2947	You're generally right—it is stereotyping to assume that someone is of a certain gender based on what activities they enjoy and it isn't accurate .	0		cmv109	2
2948	Some things fit people and others don't but as a whole we don't do a half bad job of distinguishing girls and boys ( assuming we don't argue that these ideas are set in stone ) .	1	597.0	cmv109	20
2949	Equally , there are people on the absolute opposite end of the spectrum : outliers who don't fit into any of their gender's roles .	0		cmv109	21
2950	This doesn't make their dysphoria and need to transition any less valid .	0		cmv109	22
2951	If you can't tell from my previous points , I strongly disagree with the war on gender roles : used correctly there is absolutely nothing wrong with them ( they should , of course , never be forced on someone against their will ) .	0		cmv109	23
2952	They exist for a reason , that reason being that they are fairly prevalent and our brain has decided ' Aha , I should file that ! '	0		cmv109	24
2953	However , that doesn't mean that there isn't a huge spectrum in between .	0		cmv109	25
2954	It's just a basic starting point for what our brain associates with men and women .	0		cmv109	26
2955	The second reason is that , for our emotional well-being , us trans folks absolutely * need * to be gendered correctly .	0		cmv109	27
2956	It is pivotal to our survival .	0		cmv109	28
2957	As such , there is a huge need to ' pass ' within the trans community : the easiest way to do this is to dress and act ways that are typical of the gender they want to be seen as .	0		cmv109	29
2958	However , that isn't really how it works .	0		cmv109	3
2959	It is a sad fact that people make brash judgments based on what we wear and how we present ourselves ; however , getting the average person who has never thought about gender in their life to consider that gender is really on the inside and not the outside is going to be a long and hard battle .	1	598.0	cmv109	30
2960	As such , it is just easier to conform ( and realistically it is not viable for a trans man wearing make up and showing their breasts to be seen as male to the general population—whether it should be or not is controversial even within the trans community ) .	0		cmv109	31
2961	So basically , in my opinion , it is not that a person who fits female stereotypes * must * be a woman or that a person who fits male stereotypes * must * be a man : it is that these people are women / men and as such align with some ( but generally not all ) of the tropes of their gender because they are rooted , to some extent , in truth .	0		cmv109	32
2962	I hope this is somewhat useful to you—I'm running on no sleep so if there's anything convoluted you want me to clarify or you want me to answer other , more specific questions , then go right ahead !	0		cmv109	33

3330	We live in a nation where the courts and police can be statistically shown to police minority groups more heavily than majority groups [ 2 ] , we live in a world where the courts give longer sentences to minority groups than to majority groups [ 3 ] .	1	810.0	cmv218	10
3331	Moreover , the courts have a statistically demonstrable tendency to simply not charge rich people , and on the rare occasion rich people do get into legal trouble they get lighter sentences than poor people ( if for no other reason than that rich people can afford really great lawyers , while poor people get overworked public defenders ) .	1	810.0	cmv218	11
3332	Further , we have historic evidence that the last time it was tried , mandatory sterilization was directed mainly against the poor and black .	1	810.0	cmv218	12
3333	Given all that , I would argue that the social problems caused by legally mandating sterilization are going to outweigh the benefits of having fewer children abused or neglected .	0		cmv218	13
3334	I don't like that .	0		cmv218	14
3335	I honestly wish I could support mandatory sterilization because I've seen firsthand what happens when people unfit for parenthood keep having kids .	1	806.0	cmv218	15
3336	I will say that I think the better solution is reality based , age appropriate , sex ed in schools , starting at kindergarten and continuing through graduation .	1	812.0	cmv218	16
3337	And easily available free contraception .	1	812.0	cmv218	17
3338	Because the truth is that most of the people who are having kids they abuse and neglect don't really want kids in the first place .	1	812.0	cmv218	18
3339	"This also isn't speculation , in nations where sex ed is better , and contraception is more affordable or paid for by the government , the rate of child abuse and neglect is lower than in the USA . [ 1 ] I say "" one "" because another of the big stated purposes of the America's foray into court ordered sterilization was eugenics . [ 2 ] Example : the majority of people arrested for possession of marijuana are black , despite the fact that every study done to date has shown that black people use marijuana at a significantly lower rate than white people ."	1	812.0	cmv218	19
3340	I'd argue that the problem with this is that while it makes a certain sort of sense , history shows that it would be applied for bad purposes and that the solution proposed causes more problems than it solves .	1	807.0	cmv218	2
3341	All things being equal , you'd expect the majority of arrests for possession of marijuana to be white ( not only are whites the majority , but they use pot more frequently ) .	1	813.0	cmv218	20
3342	Yet black people get arrested for it more than white people . [ 3 ] Black people get sentences about 60% longer , on average , than white people who committed the same crime .	1	813.0	cmv218	21
3343	This isn't speculation , but rather the only conclusion that can be drawn from the USA's prior history of judicially mandated sterilization .	1	807.0	cmv218	3
3344	One of the stated purposes [ 1 ] of the program was to prevent harm to children by rendering sterile those people who had demonstrated themselves to be abusive or neglectful to their children .	1	807.0	cmv218	4
3345	In practice what happened was that the program was used to sterilize as many poor white people and black people as the law could manage ( even when there was no evidence of abuse or neglect ) , and that rich white people were simply not forcibly sterilized even when abundant evidence of abuse existed .	1	807.0	cmv218	5
3346	I don't at all like the idea of people with a past history of neglect and abuse having kids .	1	805.0	cmv218	6
3347	And I'm not speaking abstrctly here , I've got relatives who are abusive and neglectful towards their children ( CPS has taken them away , and quite rightly so ) and they keep having more children ( which CPS can't take away until they manage to gather evidence of abuse and / or neglect , so the newborn has a month or three living with horrible people before CPS can do it's job and get the kids out ) .	1	805.0	cmv218	7
3348	If there were ever candidates for forcible sterilization , I know two personally and agree 100% that in a perfect world they would not be allowed to reproduce .	1	809.0	cmv218	8

3352	So when someone comes to our country and applies for an asylum , things are really very complicated and practically , there are no structures which would enable to accommodate such people in an appropriate way .	1	817.0	europolis0	3

3380	I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and , therefore , would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine .	0		peanuts87	23
3381	However , I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator .	0		peanuts87	24

3384	My allergic daughter would not consume them , but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil .	1	826.0	peanuts87	27
3385	Again , it's about personal responsibility .	1	835.0	peanuts87	28
3386	We will take care of her food .	1	835.0	peanuts87	29

3390	The airlines have no cohesive , consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about .	1	834.0	peanuts87	5
3391	It would help children , and adults , like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights .	0		peanuts87	6

3404	If I ate peanuts at the airport , didn't wash my hands , and then opened the rest room door on the plane immediately before a peanut allergy sufferer , that person could suffer a reaction .	1	841.0	peanuts192	11

3406	As someone who carries an epipen for beestings , I understand that allergies can be serious and life threatening .	1	838.0	peanuts192	2
3407	Banning airlines from serving peanuts inflight seems reasonable ; several posts mention the risk inherent in many people opening bags of peanuts at one time ( which can easily happen when snacks are served ) throwing a large amount of dust in the air , which could be enough to trigger an allergy in severely allergic people .	0		peanuts192	3
3408	However , banning people from carrying on their own snacks does seem to violate their rights , to eliminate what seems like an extremely small risk to allergy-sufferers .	1	850.0	peanuts192	4

3412	On a recent trip , I didn't have time to eat anything at all the day I flew home ; got stuck in traffic and barely made my flight ( I was the last one on ) so didn't have time to eat or buy anything at the airport ; and as we started to taxi , the flight crew announced that we had a nut allergy on board , and that they ( JB ) would not be serving cashews and requested that we not eat any nuts we may have brought on board . 6 Â½ hours feels pretty long at that point !	1	840.0	peanuts192	8

3432	What would be helpful to a passenger such as myself , would be banning the service only when a passenger requests it ahead of time or requiring a peanut-free buffer zone .	0		peanuts179	4
3433	It seems that other passengers would be less disturbed if other ( non-peanut and non-peanut oil ) snack options were provided on flights where a person has a medically-documented severe allergy , instead of relegating some people to sit in a peanut-free buffer zone .	1	870.0	peanuts179	5

3621	To me , that's just the right to not be annoyed .	0		cmv41429	10
3622	But let's talk about the right to be completely left alone - - the right to not deal with society at all , ever .	0		cmv41429	11
3623	In other words , do we , as humans , have the right from birth to not participate or be beholden to any social / national / economic / legal structure , AND the right to realistically act on that ?	0		cmv41429	12
3624	I believe the answer is YES , and any answer other than YES , at least in the current state of the world , is basically an endorsement of human rights violations .	0		cmv41429	13
3625	Here is why .	0		cmv41429	14
3626	I was never asked to join this planet , nor was I asked which of many options of nationality to choose from ( in fact , as a fully grown adult , I still can't freely choose this ) .	1	951.0	cmv41429	15
3627	I wasn't even asked whether I wanted to be a part of - - and thus tacitly approve of - - the whole nation-state structure that has been established .	1	951.0	cmv41429	16
3628	As it stands , I have no option but to agree to participate in the idea of nations , laws , global economies , currency , etc . , which I am essentially coerced into doing by legal penalty , no matter where in the world I am .	1	952.0	cmv41429	17
3629	"This is true because every habitable place on this planet has been claimed as "" property "" within the jurisdiction of some social structure , leaving me no place to physically inhabit without being subjected to another's rules / society / economy - - none of which I have any desire to participate in ."	1	952.0	cmv41429	18
3630	"I can on some practical level , opt out and live "" illegally "" on some land somewhere out of sight , but this cannot come with full peace of mind , as there will always be some looming threat of legal consequence to failure to comply with the laws of the territory I am living in ( e.g . trespassing ) ."	1	952.0	cmv41429	19
3631	I'm not sure anyone has actually convinced me to change my view thus far , though you've done well at arguing that what I'm talking about can't happen / is not a good idea for me to try / it's been shown that such an idea can't work .	0		cmv41429	2
3632	But wait , you might say , there's a workaround .	1	952.0	cmv41429	20
3633	You can buy a small piece of land and live there in isolation without ever dealing with society .	1	952.0	cmv41429	21
3634	But I don't think so .	1	952.0	cmv41429	22
3635	First of all , I have to participate in some economy I don't believe in before I can even buy that land .	1	952.0	cmv41429	23
3636	This means that I have to get a job , get a car , do all the things that make us all miserable , and participate in an economy I never asked to be a part of just so I can opt out !	1	952.0	cmv41429	24
3637	Then after that , I would have to pay property taxes on that land every year .	1	952.0	cmv41429	25
3638	Thus , I am continually forced back into participating in an economy that I want no part in just to pay for the land that I need to escape it .	1	952.0	cmv41429	26
3639	"The way I read this is that even the "" workaround "" to the essential problem posed in the previous paragraph forces me to participate in all these systems before I can even exercise the right to leave , and then once I do exercise my right to leave , the structures still force me to be bound to it ."	1	952.0	cmv41429	27
3640	In other words , I have no viable means of escape . . . . which means that I am a slave , and my human rights are being continually violated .	1	952.0	cmv41429	28

3643	In other words , you've gotten me to agree at the practical level , but no one has yet convinced me at the theoretical level , though some of you have tried to argue that my question is flawed , and that the law of being a part of a social system is literally inviolable , like laws of physics , which I'm afraid I don't buy . * * To start , let me state that I'm not a libertarian , and I identify fairly strongly as a liberal .	1	949.0	cmv41429	4

3667	I would love to see consumers use a form letter prepared by the CFPB which spells out a variety of disputes and helps them articulate the dispute better .	0		cdcp182	10
3668	I do think one of the toughest hurdles for a collector ( and one of the biggest complaints from persons against whom collection efforts are made ) is when they get a person that states the debt is not theirs ( but someone else's ) with the same name .	1	970.0	cdcp182	11
3669	We do our homework on our end to investigate ( we'll attempt to compare the last 4 digits of the social , we may run a skip trace to see if party we contacted lived at the address on the statements , etc and we will provide verification , but in a mobile world investigating that the John Smith you contacted is the same John Smith you are attempting to resolve a debt with can prove tricky .	1	964.0	cdcp182	12
3670	This is especially tricky if there is NEVER indication that we have reached the wrong person .	1	970.0	cdcp182	13
3671	We never wish to contact the wrong party regarding a debt , but it unfortunately happens because consumers don't always relay updated contacted information to creditors and a collector then has to rely upon the best information available to them .	1	968.0	cdcp182	14
3672	Unfortunately , I don't know what the fix is here .	0		cdcp182	15
3673	Despite the stories to the contrary , it simply is not the intent of any professional and responsible collection agency or firm to attempt collections from a party that does not owe the debt , but this is a hard one to address without good communication from the wrongly contacted party and the collector .	0		cdcp182	16
3674	Many disputes are difficult to investigate because it is unclear what the consumer's dispute actually is .	1	969.0	cdcp182	2
3675	If the consumer is specific enough so that there is a clear item to research , we will do so .	1	965.0	cdcp182	3
3676	"However , its a vague dispute such as "" I dispute this debt "" or "" I don't owe this debt "" ( which is incredibly common ) , then we will provide statements or a contract to attempt to address it ."	1	965.0	cdcp182	4
3677	The amount of the investigation is largely lead by the amount of detail the consumer relays , and most of it results in us relying on the documentation the creditor provides to resolve the dispute .	1	969.0	cdcp182	5
3678	Sometimes we may need to ask the creditor to research their records for indication of X , Y , or Z , but most the time the dispute isn't that specific .	1	966.0	cdcp182	6
3679	I find in my practice that we will often ask a consumer to provide information to support their dispute ( such as proof of payment ) , but then the consumer does not provide it , and we are stuck in our efforts to investigate further .	1	963.0	cdcp182	7
3680	"Requiring only a "" reasonable "" investigation without further definition sounds like a punt to the courts to decide the defintion after a lot of litigation ."	0		cdcp182	8

3692	My new way of eating took some getting used to , and required a lot of effort learning how to cook tasty meat-free dishes .	1	975.0	veganism44	4
3693	But over time I found that I took more pleasure in eating than ever before .	1	975.0	veganism44	5
3694	Almost miraculously , my taste buds seemed to grow in sensitivity once the dominant flavors of animal meat and fat were removed , allowing me to enjoy a new world of culinary experiences .	1	975.0	veganism44	6
3695	I love my whole foods , plant-based diet and will never go back .	1	975.0	veganism44	7
3696	There's plenty of evidence to show that reducing meat and dairy consumption has health benefits ( reduced heart disease , stroke , diabetes , etc ) .	1	978.0	veganism44	8
3697	Although I made the switch for health reasons , I'm glad to be doing something good for the environment at the same time .	1	976.0	veganism44	9
3698	In a religiously diverse society , favoritism would destroy respect for the country's new political institutions .	0		veganism50	2
3699	In practice , of course , a kind of generic Christianity did violate the wall between church and state , which is why Supreme Court decisions in the 1960s banning Bible-reading and officially-sponsored prayer in public schools unleashed such a storm of controversy.But in the21st century Pew research polls have documented a steady decline in the proportion of the population that identifies with any branch of Christianity .	1	979.0	veganism50	3
3700	Thus , the well-publicized efforts to display religious symbols ( Ten Commandments , manger scenes ) on public grounds amount to a rear-guard action by conservative groups , distressed by the growing secularism of American society .	0		veganism50	4
3701	This same desperate effort to hold back the tide of history helps explain the behavior of the county clerk in Kentucky who has refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples , on the grounds that to do so would violate God's law.Ms .	1	980.0	veganism50	5
3702	Davis and the champions of decorating public spaces with religious symbols will ultimately lose , but the country could have been spared one more source of political conflict if we had adhered in practice , as well as theory , to the founding principle of government neutrality in religious matters .	1	981.0	veganism50	6
3713	My friend , a respected surgeon , says he can tell if a person is a vegetarian ( V ) or canivore ( C ) with the first cut into their flesh : V's flesh breaks apart , not a clean cut .	1	987.0	veganism85	2
3714	C's flesh cuts cleanly , a very sharp incision .	1	987.0	veganism85	3
3715	The difference , nutritionally , is the presence of the amino acid creatine . 5 gms of creatine gives the same amount you would get in raw red meat .	0		veganism85	4
3716	"V's should also take Alpha-Lipoic Acid ( same thing you get in "" an apple a day "" which gets the creatine into a useful state to be ingested into the blood ."	0		veganism85	5
3717	That is a real difference that most V's do not know about their own body chemistry .	0		veganism85	6
3718	I know because for 16 years as a V , I finally learned this secret , and my energy and body turned on like a light bulb .	1	988.0	veganism85	7
3719	I'm no doctor , but for purely nutritional reasons , a strong V for 50 years now .	1	988.0	veganism85	8

3764	I just recently bought a Lenovo Ideapad Y510p - a very popular pick this year for people who want a Haswell gaming / multimedia laptop at around the $1K price ( one of / r / SuggestALaptop ' s most recommended ) .	1	1011.0	cmv1441	5
3765	It runs Windows 8.1 now .	1	1011.0	cmv1441	6

3767	It was fantastic for all of the typical reasons people by Macbooks : * aluminum unibody - sturdy , sexy , easy to clean * Mac OSX user interface * glass trackpad - every Windows laptop's trackpad sucks compared to the Macbook * automatic micromanaging of music files in iTunes * integration with my iPhone and iPad . * lightweight , easy to carry around - Y510P is just too much of a tank to carry Now I've been using the Lenovo for about 2 months , and I'm starting to realize that I miss a lot of the things about Mac OSX and how it babies you .	1	1011.0	cmv1441	8

3772	The collection agency has this information readily available .	0		cdcp180	13

3775	In most cases , it is being reported from the original creditor already .	0		cdcp180	16
3776	And if it isn't , this should be a red flag to CRA's that the debt is not valid .	0		cdcp180	17

3788	As we know , if we dispute with the CRA and ask for a reinvestigation , all that will be done is the social security number will be matched and verified with the amount owed .	1	1020.0	cdcp180	4

3791	"This is because current laws suggest that the collection agency provide the consumer with information "" such as "" the name and address of the original creditor , and the amount owed ."	0		cdcp180	7
3792	This does not prove a debt is still owed , and to whom it is owed .	0		cdcp180	8
3793	If we are going to allow companies to buy debts for amounts as low as pennies on the dollar , then the burden of proof MUST lie with the collection agency .	0		cdcp180	9

3939	Not one company called me to give the the credit , so they should not call my cell and cost me more money that will prolong them getting paid .	1	1110.0	cdcp191	7
3940	Besides , most of the calls are robo-calls with no message ever being left so I never know who the call is for .	1	1110.0	cdcp191	8
3941	I guess I should also have clarified in my previous comment that I have made attempts to deal with creditors directly if I know who they are and who they claim to be representing but my personal perception is they PREFER to continue contacting 3rd parties because they hope I'll just pay them to avoid the public humiliation .	1	1116.0	cdcp230	2
3942	And in regards to a comment I read here that creditors can call a 3rd party again if they have a reasonable belief that the person knows how to contact the debtor , I disagree with that entirely .	0		cdcp230	3
3943	First of all , I'm not aware of any law that compels a 3rd party to provide current contact information for a debtor , so even if they do know where that debtor is , they don't deserve to be harassed daily for months or years as punishment for not offering up that information .	0		cdcp230	4
3944	Many people don't want to be involved and no law that I know of says they have to if they aren't a party to the debt .	0		cdcp230	5

3957	So , why should debt collections be different , why should they break the norms .	0		cdcp97	10
3958	I think limitation is good as not to harass .	0		cdcp97	2
3959	I think it has been generally defined as 3 - 4 days per day , though I think that is still excessive , and any collector who follows that is clearly trying to harass .	0		cdcp97	3
3960	Who else would someone call 3 - 4 times in a day ?	0		cdcp97	4
3961	But , with the example of 1 call per day , I would think that there would also need to be another limitation such as 1 call per day or no more than 4 calls in a week .	1	1130.0	cdcp97	5
3962	Otherwise , a collector could call 1 time a day , 7 times a week , 30 times in a month , etc .	1	1130.0	cdcp97	6
3963	And personally , in my personal phone calls and in my business phone calls , it can take me more than a day or two to return a message .	1	1127.0	cdcp97	7

4030	I think my view on sex is rooted in jealousy .	1	1161.0	cmv29381	3
4031	I have difficulty with the concept of that period in dating where you've begun to have sex with someone , but you are not committed to one another yet .	1	1161.0	cmv29381	4
4032	I think this really holds me back .	0		cmv29381	5
4033	This is not even to start with the concept of one-night stands , which I similarly would have extreme difficulty going through with .	0		cmv29381	6
4034	The problem is , I think none of these views on sex are rooted in healthy motivations .	0		cmv29381	7
4035	I think I avoid one-night stands because it's difficult to admit that some women will not be attracted enough to me to want a relationship , but are attracted enough to want to have sex .	0		cmv29381	8
4036	Secondly , I feel like there's an unhealthy possessiveness in wanting instant commitment .	0		cmv29381	9
4042	I know this , you know this , lets not discuss it .	0		cmv50865	2
4043	So , I think this is a pretty common viewpoint among smokers - pre-made cigarettes have a bunch of additives and stuff ( eg . it seems modern cigarettes have paper which is supposed to stop burning if you don't puff , obviously you need more chemicals to do this and you just end up inhaling them ) , while when rolling your own you are putting in just tobacco , so it has to be healthier .	0		cmv50865	3
4044	I agree with this .	0		cmv50865	4
4045	"Roll your own also has other benefits - they tend to be more cost-effective ( but lets disregard this ) , and the common wisdom is that you will smoke less of them since you have to roll them and this takes time , so you end up smoking less in total , thus making them "" healthier "" ."	0		cmv50865	5
4046	Then again , I guess you can just add in a ton of tobacco and offset these effects .	0		cmv50865	6
4047	So , is there a ( noticeable ) health benefit from moving to roll-your-own , or are they the same ?	0		cmv50865	7
4048	I don't really feel that premade cigarettes can be healthier , but if they are , please prove me wrong .	0		cmv50865	8

4226	I think it's perfectly rational to wash a duvet cover once a year even with regular use providing you are using sheets under them .	0		cmv36367	2
4227	The whole point of a bed sheet is that it's a small barrier to keep you from making contact with your duvet and maybe a minimal thermal insulation .	0		cmv36367	3
4228	The sheets are what gets dirty and require frequent laundering if you're sleeping responsibly .	0		cmv36367	4
4229	Now I'll make concessions for people who sweat profusely , commonly wake up wrapped in your duvet or if it obviously becomes dirty through . . . other . . . means .	1	1263.0	cmv36367	5
4230	If you're the kind of person who changes their bedfellows frequently , then yeah , by all means , wash that stank off .	1	1264.0	cmv36367	6
4231	For the responsible sleeper , minimal contact with the duvet is made and should not warrant washing other than the regular buildup of grime that any throw blanket that never leaves the back of . . . some chair in your house or something .	0		cmv36367	7
4232	Plus the things are a pain in the ass to fold .	1	1265.0	cmv36367	8
4233	Yeah , I've seen the duvet burrito video , it still sucks to put back in commission after washing .	1	1265.0	cmv36367	9
4234	And in reality , if a debt collector / debt owner can not resolve their clients issues within the already established SOL of each state , then extending the SOL or having a national SOL under which to bring suit does nothing but allow debt collectors to continue to harass consumers .	0		cdcp294	10
4235	Three years really is more than enough time to sue .	0		cdcp294	11
4236	Just as criminal defendants are entitled to a quick and speedy trail , so should consumers who may / may not be aware they have an outstanding debt .	0		cdcp294	12
4237	That is to say : having a national SOL is a guise to prolong resolution rather than a more quick a final resolve in when to bring suit .	0		cdcp294	13
4238	I would disagree that there is confusion among consumers about SOL which would , as you suggest , require the need for a national SOL .	0		cdcp294	2
4239	The only time I have personally seen SOL straddle a line is when a consumer moves to another state with a different SOL .	1	1266.0	cdcp294	3
4240	The clarity needs to be in these such cases .	1	1267.0	cdcp294	4
4241	Because once a debtor moves , both parties claim the SOL where it benefits them for their desired outcome .	1	1267.0	cdcp294	5
4242	A national SOL only benefits the debt collectors and not the consumers .	0		cdcp294	6
4243	The focus should remain on creating , as best as possible , a win-win solution that benefits the debt collectors the consumers .	0		cdcp294	7
4244	Having a national SOL of 7 years as ACA International wants compromises state laws wherein some states of SOL of 3 years ( and otherwise less than 7 ) .	0		cdcp294	8

5039	It has also made me paranoid about my own finances .	1	1616.0	cdcp165	11
5040	I have been a frequent target of debt collectors and their phone calls for several years .	1	1614.0	cdcp165	2
5041	The reason , clearly , is because I have a common last name .	1	1614.0	cdcp165	3
5042	I do not have any debts .	1	1614.0	cdcp165	4
5043	First , once a debt collector starts calling me , it is extremely difficult to get rid of them .	1	1615.0	cdcp165	5
5044	One outfit called me a liar and kept calling .	1	1615.0	cdcp165	6
5045	Another went after me for two different people .	1	1615.0	cdcp165	7
5046	Second , yes , a barrage of collection calls can be harmful .	1	1622.0	cdcp165	8
5047	Dealing with debt collectors on a daily basis has taken its toll on my physical and mental health .	1	1616.0	cdcp165	9
5048	I speak from personal experience .	1	1623.0	veganism60	2
5049	WereI not crystal clear about the moral baseline not one of the many vegans whom I have educated would be vegan .	1	1624.0	veganism60	3

5061	Probability-wise , I would imagine that the odds of any particular man attacking me ( even if he has greater opportunity to do so ) are less than the odds of one of many people attacking me , even if they only have a small chance each .	0		cmv18395	2

5063	I would guess that walking with a woman might be even safer , although I'm unsure of the probability of two women being attacked vs . a woman and a man .	0		cmv18395	4

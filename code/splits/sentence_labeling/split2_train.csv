1	There are many thing which are horrible .	0		cmv217	3

7	On a plane 2 years ago , when my son was 3 , he came into contact the carpeting below the seat and developed hives .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	2
8	We looked and saw an old peanut under the seat in front of us .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	3
9	He has a documented peanut allergy .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	4
10	I suspect that there was residual peanut in the carpet that he came into contact with .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	5
11	I am fairly certain that this 3 year-old boy he did not get hives because he was ' stressed out ' .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	6
12	Fortunately all he got was hives , but as best we could tell he did not have a serious ingestion ( and our leg of the flight was peanut-free after we had notified the airline of his allergy at booking and check-in ) .	1	1636.0	peanuts759	7
13	Please also see posts above citing the peer reviewed medical literature regarding the prevalence of food allergies , and specifically peanut allergies , in children .	0		peanuts759	8
14	So , while it is possible to have an IgE-mediated reaction solely from emotional stress , this was not the case here .	0		peanuts759	9
18	It's a tough subject to debate .	0		peanuts772	10
19	Maybe airlines should ask when purchasing a ticket as to whether or not they are traveling with someone who has an allergy .	0		peanuts772	11
20	Based on answers , they can then plan for seating accordingly .	0		peanuts772	12
21	Some baseball stadiums have peanut free sections , and airplanes should too !	0		peanuts772	13
22	I suffer from a tree nut allergy , with sensitivity to peanuts .	1	1642.0	peanuts772	2
23	Like anyone who has an anaphylactic allergy , I always carry my epi-pen and benedryl everywhere I go .	1	1642.0	peanuts772	3
24	I always get nervous when flying at the thought of going into anaphylactic shock mid-air , and believe that something needs to be done to protect people with true food allergies .	1	1642.0	peanuts772	4
25	I think to start , serving peanuts should be banned .	0		peanuts772	5
26	The degree of the allergy varies from person to person , but banning the actual product would help a lot of people right away .	0		peanuts772	6
27	Food that might be shared on the same equipment or may contain nuts should still be allowed to respect the other side's rights .	0		peanuts772	7
28	I also think there should be peanut free seating on planes that are priority to people with allergies .	0		peanuts772	8
29	That would eliminate the chance of my neighbor eating nuts .	0		peanuts772	9
35	They are widely considered trailblazers in this regard exactly because they did go there and by doing so paved the way for other bands to do what they did , only more so .	1	1652.0	cmv229	10
36	Finally , there has never been a band that has had as big a cultural impact before and since .	0		cmv229	11
37	People would maybe argue Elvis in America , but I would personally put the Beatles above that .	0		cmv229	12
38	The simple fact that female fans would have genuine [ manic episodes ] ( just from seeing the Beatles ( something that did not happen before ) says a lot .	0		cmv229	13
39	I also did some research on the cultural impact the Beatles had on Liverpool and London , and it is remarkable . / / Along with that comes that , if you look purely at the quality of music that the Beatles produced you should be able to see that they have produced an enormous amount of arguably high quality music in a short time .	1	1653.0	cmv229	14
40	And the other bands know it too .	1	1654.0	cmv229	15
41	The Who stated they were highly influenced by the Beatles ( and the Beatles by them in return , just listen to [ Helter Skelter ] ( and I would argue that you can definitely hear some Beatles influences in both Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd , albeit more subtle .	1	1654.0	cmv229	16
42	They were way before their time in a way that no other band has been able to emulate , be it in musical quality , diversity of material , evolution , quality and volume of music produced in a short timespan , and mass appeal .	1	1654.0	cmv229	17
43	There has simply not been a band that has been able to deliver this complete package in the way that the Beatles did .	1	1654.0	cmv229	18
44	The main problem with this reasoning is that you're looking at the Beatles from our current perspective as opposed to looking at what they did from the perspective of someone who was around at the time .	0		cmv229	2
45	Other posters have discussed the technical advancements they ushered in , so instead I will try to explain the cultural impact they've had .	0		cmv229	3
46	When the Beatles entered the scene ( I wasn't around at the time , so this is taken from anecdotal evidence ) , much of the popular music was akin to what the Beatles released on Please Please Me , their first release .	1	1650.0	cmv229	4
47	It was practically unheard of ( at the time ) for artists to progress the way that the Beatles did .	1	1650.0	cmv229	5
48	Off the top of my head , I cannot think of a single artist that progressed as quick and as vast as they did in as little time , while still holding onto what made their music uniquely theirs .	1	1650.0	cmv229	6
49	There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both [ I Wanna Hold Your Hand ] ( and [ Tomorrow Never Knows ] ( very different songs , I admit , and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large ) in a way that is . . . natural .	1	1650.0	cmv229	7
50	They progressed as opposed to mutated .	1	1650.0	cmv229	8
51	Along with that comes the fact that bands like Radiohead would not have existed at the time ( that is to say , experimental bands that still achieved large mainstream appeal ) and would arguably never had achieved mainstream success or even existed were it not for the Beatles .	1	1651.0	cmv229	9
52	Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor , along with the janitor that was in basements burns . 4 .	1	1658.0	cmv201	10
53	Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene .	1	1658.0	cmv201	11
54	Im honestly not sure what to make of all this evidence , but something just strikes me as unsettling , and I see a lot of skeptics to whom I look up to ( Micheal Shermer , Bill Maher to a lesser degree , etc . ) dismissing the notion and Im not sure what Im overlooking that they arent .	0		cmv201	12
55	Im swearing into the Navy on Wednesday and this is the my biggest cause of apprehension about joining the war machine so hopefully one or more of you fine people can CMV !	0		cmv201	13
56	disclaimer : First Post so I apologize in advance if I am in violation of any rules or protocol EDIT : That didn't take long .	0		cmv201	14
57	Thanks to those who responded , now I'll rejoin the ranks of the lurkers .	0		cmv201	15
58	EDIT #2 : So a SHIT TON of new comments over night , and sorry to say I cant address them individually , not that yall are craving my opinion , but I read them all and its good to note that other seemingly intelligent people shared my concerns and skepticism and I really enjoyed the healthy discourse below .	0		cmv201	16
59	Both sides have produced compelling arguments but after reassessing probability figures and relinquishing my right to observe evidence and draw my own conclusions due to my egregious lack of knowledge on the subject , the reality is that it would be insurmountably difficult to orchestrate something of this magnitude .	0		cmv201	17
60	I still think its a little fishy , but my common sense tells me thats probably due to authorities lack of a clear picture , not direct involvement and subsequent cover up .	0		cmv201	18
61	Thanks again for playing , hope to see you all again .	0		cmv201	19
62	I believe 9 / 11 was an inside job .	0		cmv201	2
63	EDIT #3 : here is a [ link ] ( to a post in / r / conspiracy detailing the arguments that cast doubt on the official story in much better detail than I had previously .	0		cmv201	20
64	Another redditor brought that to my attention and thought you guys may have a go at it .	0		cmv201	21
65	CMV Around my senior year of high school ( 2009 - ish ) I became quite interested in public events and foreign relations and wanted to become more knowledgeable about how the United States compared to the other nations without the star-spangled bias you get from public school and fox news .	1	1655.0	cmv201	3
66	Not too long after that I was exposed to 9 / 11 : In Plane Site as well as others , and the copious amounts of conspiracy videos of YouTube .	1	1655.0	cmv201	4
67	As someone of above average intelligence and a skeptic by nature I have never taken conspiracy theories too seriously , as many rely on sparse circumstantial evidence but for whatever reason this feels different .	1	1655.0	cmv201	5
68	My main reasons for suspecting foul play in order of importance : 1 .	0		cmv201	6
69	BUILDING 7 ! ? ! ?	0		cmv201	7
70	2 .	0		cmv201	8
71	The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns . 3 .	1	1658.0	cmv201	9
82	It's not a joking matter ; I would guess we have fewer complications because people with peanut issues don't fly .	1	1673.0	peanuts607	10
83	But this is a minority , and I would not support a ban on peanuts existing on an airplane .	0		peanuts607	11
84	but do we really need airlines to serve peanuts ?	0		peanuts607	12
85	This reaction isn't actually about peanuts at all .	0		peanuts607	13
86	Are we talking about airlines not providing peanuts , or peanuts not being allowed on an airplane ?	0		peanuts607	2
87	These are two VERY different issues .	0		peanuts607	3
88	I would be indifferent to rules preventing airlines from serving peanuts ( actually , I would welcome it , because I like the crackers better ! ) .	0		peanuts607	4
89	People who want peanuts can bring their own , easily enough .	0		peanuts607	5
90	Should people be banned from bringing their own peanuts ?	0		peanuts607	6
91	No .	0		peanuts607	7
92	And honestly , people would be more effective using market forces to convince airlines to change their menus .	0		peanuts607	8
93	I do have a cousin who legitimately goes into anaphylactic shock at exposure to peanuts .	1	1672.0	peanuts607	9
94	Tiffany , the DOT is just recognizing a product that is being provided by companies that pose a serious threat to a fairly large number of people .	0		peanuts401	2
95	Most other products aboard flights are considered non-allergenic or do not have particulates that become airborne which is the case with the bagged peanuts .	0		peanuts401	3
96	Also , finding another mode of transportation is not an option for me as I might be the Captain on your flight one day .	1	1675.0	peanuts401	4
97	Your suggestions are that discard 26,000 hours of flight experience and not fly or use my epipen because airlines wish to serve peanuts ?	0		peanuts401	5
98	I would think that suggestion is not realistic .	0		peanuts401	6
99	"I understand that for those who do not have that / an allergy it might seem "" overblown "" but I can assure you that overall , it is not ."	0		peanuts401	7
100	It is simply a desire to eliminate a #1 food allergy product that can become airborne in a small , pressurized aluminum ( soon to be carbon fiber with the 787 ! )	0		peanuts401	8
101	tube .	0		peanuts401	9
102	Raisins .	0		peanuts617	10
103	Whatever .	0		peanuts617	11
104	"It sounds like your "" awful "" experiences have not resulted in any allergic reactions ."	0		peanuts617	12
105	Bans on foods should be based exclusively on research .	0		peanuts617	13
106	Not on people feeling uncomfortable around certain foods .	0		peanuts617	14
107	Because if that's what regulations are based on , then there will soon be nothing served on any flight - and I don't think that's what anyone wants .	0		peanuts617	15
108	Again , I hope the DOT seriously considers actual research when making regulations .	0		peanuts617	16
109	I appreciate your circumstance .	0		peanuts617	2
110	But because you don't like the smell of nuts , we can't go instituting bans on foods .	0		peanuts617	3
111	I don't like the smell of fast food - does that mean there needs to be a ban on people bringing McD's on board ?	1	1676.0	peanuts617	4
112	As for food options , pack you own .	0		peanuts617	5
113	I do .	1	1677.0	peanuts617	6
114	I bring my own snacks .	1	1677.0	peanuts617	7
115	People with severe metabolic conditions like PKU travel with their own food .	0		peanuts617	8
116	Bring a bag of pretzels .	0		peanuts617	9
117	What a lot of people don't realize is that peanut allergies actually worsen as a person ages .	0		peanuts213	2
118	I have had a fatal peanut allergy all my life , and at age 28 , I found my throat swelling from the smell of peanut products .	1	1678.0	peanuts213	3
119	Also , EpiPens are great , but they DO NOT stop the reaction to all people .	1	1678.0	peanuts213	4
120	I carry two injections with me all the time , and those injections buy me an hour to get to a hospital for further treatment .	1	1678.0	peanuts213	5
121	Without a hospital and immediate follow-up care , I would continue in a reaction .	1	1683.0	peanuts213	6
122	TO CONGRESS : YES , it can happen , it does happen , it will continue to happen , and as I AM AFRAID TO FLY FOR THIS VERY REASON , I urge you to do something !	0		peanuts213	7
123	You cannot count on EpiPens to do everything !	0		peanuts213	8
124	I vote for banning all peanut products AND making an announcement , asking passengers to refrain from eating any peanut products they may have brought on board , if a passenger informs the airline about his / her allergy .	0		peanuts213	9
131	During the snack a member of the flight crew pointed at us and told the other passengers that he could not offer them peanut M & Ms because there was an allergy sufferer on board .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	10
132	Thankfully , after a dose of benadryl my son was fine .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	11
133	I do think the passenger should come equipped with medication if case of exposure .	0		peanuts70	12
134	Most severe allergy suffers carry medicine with them anyway .	0		peanuts70	13
135	It would not hurt for the airline to carry addition medication because the epi-pen only allows 20 minutes to seek immediate medical attention .	0		peanuts70	14
136	I don't see the harm in banning at least the service of peanuts on the airlines .	0		peanuts70	2
137	The ban should include all peanut and peanut containing products .	0		peanuts70	3
138	Recently we flew across the country and followed all of the procedures the airline gave us in turn they promised to clean seats and create a buffer zone to sheild my 3 year old son from any peanut exposure .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	4
139	As I walked to me seat expecting what I was promised I find left over peanuts in our seats !	1	1686.0	peanuts70	5
140	I came prepared with wipes and medicine just in case .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	6
141	The airline offered no assistance in fixing the problem .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	7
142	After cleaning everything up and getting all settled in , I had to hold my son for the next 5 hours because it was too risky .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	8
143	At the onset of an attack the use of an epi-pen would give us about 20 minutes to be in a hospital .	1	1686.0	peanuts70	9
144	I urge strong consideration of a complete ban on peanuts during all domestic flights .	0		peanuts979	2
145	Due to severe peanut allergy , I can now only fly on flights that ban peanuts completely .	1	1690.0	peanuts979	3
146	I live in Minnesota where Delta recently purchased Northwest Airlines ( Northwest was peanut-free ) .	1	1692.0	peanuts979	4
147	A peanut-free buffer zone is not sufficient protection from air that is circulated throughout a plane's cabin .	0		peanuts979	5
148	Nor does such a zone protect from peanut residue left behind from previous flights .	0		peanuts979	6
149	It seems illogical to serve a highly allergy-inducing product on airliners at 30,000 feet when unlimited other snack options exist .	0		peanuts979	7
150	I can only surmise that a strong lobby effort and financial incentives have kept peanuts on airplanes , to the peril of allergic individuals ( customers ) and the liability of the carriers .	0		peanuts979	8
153	I also suggest that airlines offer environmentally-controlled sections for travelers with peanut allergies .	0		peanuts819	10
154	I follow a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet to control reactive hypoglycemia .	1	1697.0	peanuts819	2
155	My diet requires small meals throughout the day .	1	1697.0	peanuts819	3
156	Before the advent of TSA restrictions on carry-on liquids , I was able to pack coldcut sandwiches with an ice pack in my carry-on luggage .	1	1697.0	peanuts819	4
157	Since ice packs are no longer allowed , I rely on peanuts and peanut products to meet my dietary needs while traveling , as they are non-perishable .	1	1697.0	peanuts819	5
158	If peanuts were no longer allowed on flights , it would be challenging to find an acceptable non-perishable that would meet my dietary needs .	1	1702.0	peanuts819	6
159	I cannot rely on airlines to serve snacks that I can eat and , when peanuts are offered , they are usually the only snack that would not precipitate a hypoglycemic reaction ( meat-product jerky is not an acceptable option ) .	0		peanuts819	7
160	I understand that peanut allergies are life-threatening , as is hypoglycemia .	0		peanuts819	8
161	In the interest of accommodating both sets of needs , I suggest that airlines offer a high-protein snack , such as cheese sticks ( perhaps by pre-request ) .	0		peanuts819	9
171	Mulder , I like peanuts , but I don't consider it my right to have airlines serve them to me .	1	1711.0	peanuts602	2
172	I don't think they need to .	1	1711.0	peanuts602	3
173	Plenty of times I'm not thrilled with what I am offered so I usually bring my own .	1	1710.0	peanuts602	4
174	I think some of this is just outrage that someone dare put a regulation on something .	0		peanuts602	5
175	But I don't think passengers should be banned from bringing peanut products on the flight .	0		peanuts602	6
176	There's a compromise that can be struck .	0		peanuts602	7
177	I wish I was on my home computer so I could browse my collection of contemporary art and show you some of my favourites .	1	1716.0	cmv199	10
178	For now , pick up an issue of Juxtapoz or Spectrum 21 to see the kind of cool things that are happening right now .	0		cmv199	11
179	Some I picked up just from a quick browse of Juxtapoz's website : [ David Mach's coat hanger sculpture ] ( [ Chiharu Shiota's installations ] ( and [ Stephanie Clark's embrodiery ] ( It's worth pointing out a lot of contemporary artists are now doing things on larger scales or with materials that cannot be properly represented online ( eg video , the texture of string , illusions that can only be felt from a certain perspective in the room ) .	1	1717.0	cmv199	12
180	If you're not regularly setting foot in galleries , you're missing a lot of great stuff .	0		cmv199	13
181	please .	0		cmv199	2
182	I work in an art gallery .	1	1713.0	cmv199	3
183	You'd be amazed at how much crap there is pre - 1950s that manages to survive .	1	1714.0	cmv199	4
184	"There were big trends of "" artists "" who pre-painted torsos and then hastily painted their client's heads on top , because it was a quick way for the average joe to make some decent money without much talent ."	1	1715.0	cmv199	5
185	Half of these guys didn't even bother painting a coherent hand .	1	1715.0	cmv199	6
186	There will always be amateurs , con artists , and plain art you don't like screwing up what you would otherwise consider a great era .	0		cmv199	7
187	Also , you seem to have an issue with 1970s abstract expressionism and are using it to represent all contemporary art .	0		cmv199	8
188	There is a lot of fantastic stuff out there today , but as with all kinds of creations , most of it will be crap or stuff you don't like .	0		cmv199	9
189	Thankfully that type of exposure is not life threatening ( at least not yet ) but the concern is very real .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	10
190	I am not a child , I am not traveling for pleasure and I don't have the power of completely removing something that can be life threatening for me while at work so I do the best I can to continue safely performing my duties as an airline pilot .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	11
191	I support the ban for airlines not to serve bagged peanut products and support the requirement that a public address announcement be made for those that have brought their own on board refrain from consuming them .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	12
192	When traveling in the cabin , I am always aware of those around me and what they are consuming .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	13
193	I have come to find that my sensitivity is mostly a distance of 1 row forward and back and two seats laterally ( about 5 - 6 feet ) .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	14
194	If I can detect the odor of peanuts then I become concerned .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	15
195	In case you were wondering , yes I do carry an epinephrine auto injector ( never used one ) , Allegra and antihistamine eye drops .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	16
196	Not having peanuts served during a flight would be of great benefit for me and other allergy sufferers .	0		peanuts400	17
197	As a side note , commercial grade , not cold pressed , peanut oil is fine for most peanut allergy sufferers .	0		peanuts400	18
198	The process of extracting the oil leaves none of the offending protein .	0		peanuts400	19
199	I could not be happier if airlines discontinue serving peanuts on flights .	0		peanuts400	2
200	I have consumed many products prepared with peanut oil , albeit with great trepidation , and have not had any adverse reactions .	1	1721.0	peanuts400	20
201	As a life long peanut allergy sufferer , I have always held out hope that airlines would recognize that they are providing their passengers with the #1 food allergy product .	0		peanuts400	3
202	I have seen many arguments that they should be banned in restaurants , ballparks etc . , however , those venues are completely voluntary ( establishments that promote / provide peanuts that are shelled and thrown on the floor do not get my business ) but airline travel is a closed quarters , necessity for many people .	0		peanuts400	4
203	I , for one , have to contend with residue and airborne particulate from those little bags of roasted peanuts served on aircraft almost on a daily basis since I am an airline Captain .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	5
204	For 22 years I have been meticulous with keeping my work environment ( flight deck ) safe for me by not consuming items that may contain peanuts , avoiding touching my eyes and asking my co-pilot not to consume bagged peanuts ( other peanut products that don't risk going airborne are usually ok ) .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	6
205	Unfortunately , my ability to control my environment becomes more difficult when I am assigned a reposition flight and must ride as a passenger .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	7
206	I advise the flight attendants and hope they remember .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	8
207	I have suffered mild / moderate anaphyalactic and asthmatic distress if I am unaware that someone opened a bag of peanuts .	1	1720.0	peanuts400	9
208	I would argue the contrary : Humans are benevolent and social creatures , that are very capable of violence .	0		cmv172	10
209	Think about it .	0		cmv172	11
210	You are less likely to die of violence today , than ever before , why ?	0		cmv172	12
211	Because we built our societies in ways that prevent violence more and more .	1	1732.0	cmv172	13
212	Are we having setbacks ?	1	1732.0	cmv172	14
213	Of course !	1	1732.0	cmv172	15
214	Thousands of years ago , we had to use a lot more violence to survive .	1	1732.0	cmv172	16
215	Hunt animals down and kill them , defend them against other humans ( not brutal humans , * hungry * humans ) .	1	1732.0	cmv172	17
216	But we always made our best efforts , to make everything safer and safer .	1	1732.0	cmv172	18
217	We rebuilt and tried to make it better .	1	1732.0	cmv172	19
218	I have thought * * a lot * * about this topic .	1	1729.0	cmv172	2
219	And can you argue against the fact , that we have the most comfortable live ( on average ) today , than any generation before us ?	0		cmv172	20
220	Why ?	0		cmv172	21
221	Because we are brutal and uncivilzed ?	0		cmv172	22
222	That does not make sense .	0		cmv172	23
223	I live in germany , so by default I have been confronted with the topic in school many times .	1	1729.0	cmv172	3
224	History was my strongest class .	1	1729.0	cmv172	4

961	As a graduate student , I studied at a university eight hours from home .	1	2064.0	peanuts480	15
962	A few months ago , there was a family emergency at home .	1	2064.0	peanuts480	16
963	My choices were to drive eight hours , thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed , or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time .	1	2064.0	peanuts480	17
964	I chose the flight , taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy .	1	2064.0	peanuts480	18
965	"They created a "" peanut-free zone "" around me , serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me ."	1	2064.0	peanuts480	19
966	I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now , and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban .	0		peanuts480	2
967	I still had a mild reaction ( no use of the EpiPen , in other words , but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane ) , so that when I did arrive at the hospital , I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one .	1	2064.0	peanuts480	20
968	Towards the end of graduate school , I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them .	1	2065.0	peanuts480	21
969	For offices that were far away , I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city .	1	2065.0	peanuts480	22
970	I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air , but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication .	1	2065.0	peanuts480	23
971	I've had allergies since the age of 2 , so I understand that sometimes , my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others .	1	2068.0	peanuts480	24
972	But when I take all necessary precautions and still , my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one , because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts , isn't that a little ridiculous ?	1	2068.0	peanuts480	25
973	Is this really a fair result ?	0		peanuts480	26

975	Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights ?	0		peanuts480	28
976	It sounds dramatic , but it's not melodramatic .	0		peanuts480	29
977	First , I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies , and related to that , good parenting .	0		peanuts480	3
978	The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights .	0		peanuts480	30
979	This is certainly understandable , given the increase in peanut allergies among children .	0		peanuts480	4
980	But it neglects another perspective - namely , the adult allergy sufferer .	0		peanuts480	5
981	I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 ( and I am now in my late 20s ) .	1	2063.0	peanuts480	6
982	By the age of 6 , I knew how to take my medications myself .	1	2063.0	peanuts480	7
983	Since the EpiPen has come out , I've carried epinephrine with me .	1	2063.0	peanuts480	8
984	And I've always had various other medications - e.g . inhaler - on hand .	1	2063.0	peanuts480	9
1025	If we re-seat , who moves ?	1	2103.0	peanuts734	10
1026	The family of 4 with the allergy , or the family of 4 that wants to eat the food they brought on board ?	1	2103.0	peanuts734	11

1029	Do I then need to change seats ?	1	2102.0	peanuts734	2
1030	This is where the holes in the plan becomes apparent .	0		peanuts734	3
1031	Eliminating bags of peanuts is not the issue - that's easy .	0		peanuts734	4
1032	It's how do you then deal with every potential peanut product passengers bring on board ?	0		peanuts734	5
1033	Because to truly eliminate any potential for airborne peanut ( for the moment , let's ignore whether that poses a real risk or not ) , passengers would not be able to bring any food on-board , because even home-made sandwiches could contain nuts .	0		peanuts734	6
1034	And personally , I don't think you can go that far .	0		peanuts734	7
1035	And so far on this comment board , no one has been able to address that issue .	0		peanuts734	8
1036	So , what good is banning airlines from serving bags of peanuts if a passenger brings on a PBJ sandwich , or opens an energy bar that contains nuts ?	1	2103.0	peanuts734	9

1181	I've also heard in the past of some airlines forcing passengers to sign statements acknowledging that they will not stop the flight and seek assistance if an allergic reaction happens .	1	2157.0	peanuts118	8
1182	I think it was American Airlines and I read the actual documents .	1	2157.0	peanuts118	9

1210	Also if we look for dating sites on the internet , it's just more complex , because in my experience there are 10 males for 1 female on dating sites ( aprox ) .	1	2176.0	cmv90	17

1254	The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved * * significantly * * less stopping than the average driver makes .	1	2187.0	cmv46	10
1255	At steady speed highway driving , you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size / efficiency combustion engines because it is simple physics .	0		cmv46	11
1256	What you don't seem to be taking into account ( or at least understating the importance of ) is regenerative braking . 100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking .	0		cmv46	12
1257	Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [ as much as 50% ] ( of that energy .	0		cmv46	13
1258	For the sake of keeping things honest , let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient .	0		cmv46	14
1259	See the importance of regenerative braking ?	0		cmv46	15
1260	Using Newton's 2nd law , we can estimate that to get up to speed , Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy ( and fuel ) than Non-Hybrid X , but then when they both stop , Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses .	0		cmv46	16
1261	This is especially important because vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed ( Newton's 1st law ) .	0		cmv46	17
1262	Yes , weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road , but the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all .	0		cmv46	18
1263	So to summarize : Driving at a steady speed - slightly better fuel economy for non-Hybrids .	0		cmv46	19
1264	& gt ; 1 - In order to function , a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries , a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components ( eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking ) .	0		cmv46	2
1265	Driving with braking - significantly better fuel economy for Hybrids .	0		cmv46	20
1266	So like I said before , unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving ( and even then the highway better not be very busy ) , a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart .	0		cmv46	21
1267	[ According to the Prius wiki ] ( the battery pack weighs 118 lbs .	0		cmv46	3
1268	Since I can't find a figure online , let's say the electric motor components ( which are the major components for regenerative braking ) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing .	0		cmv46	4
1269	So 218 pounds out of a total of around [ 2900 lb curb weight ] ( puts ~ 7.5% more weight onto the vehicle .	0		cmv46	5
1270	Not as much as one might think .	0		cmv46	6
1271	( It's also the weight of a full grown adult , so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo .	0		cmv46	7
1272	Yes , that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy but it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking .	0		cmv46	8
1273	& gt ; It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius , and completely remove all of the electrical components , it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid .	1	2187.0	cmv46	9

1782	This will require flexibility and generosity of spirit on the part of all people involved ( and I do recognize is likely to be annoying ) but , in truth , is not that big of a deal when compared to a significant safety issue .	0		peanuts741	11
1783	The other factor here is that I am , in truth , less worried about a nearby PBJ sandwich or a Snickers bar than I am about a bag of raw peanuts as these foods are less likely to have particles that go airborne .	1	2413.0	peanuts741	12
1784	It does not mean that I am unconcerned but just that they pose less risk .	1	2413.0	peanuts741	13
1785	Finally , if necessary , I am more than prepared to either 1 ) give an affected passenger food that we brought on the plane that is peanut safe if they are really hungry ( we always bring plenty of extra ' safe ' food ) or will gladly fork over the additional $5 - $50 to buy them / their family whatever in-flight food they want if it means that they will not expose my family to peanut allergens in close proximity .	1	2411.0	peanuts741	14

1790	Also , foods like PBJ sandwiches are really easy to fly with - no refrigeration required .	0		peanuts741	5
1791	So , what I think needs to happen : 1 ) The airlines themselves do not serve peanut products 2 ) The airlines have clearly documented / posted allergy policies with education of staff ( and encouragement of passenger awareness of these policies ) to increase awareness that there may need to be some seat flexibility for people intending to eat peanut products from home during the flight if seated near peanut-allergic individuals .	0		peanuts741	6
1792	A key reason for this is that people deal with change better when it is expected , so if there is education in advance regarding these policies and issues , then seat changes or similar interventions are more likely to go smoothly .	0		peanuts741	7

2449	I have lived my entire life with a peanut allergy ; I carry emergency medicines with me at all times .	1	337.0	peanuts671	2

2451	Having read ingredient labels for my entire life , I am no longer surprised by the unlikely foods that contain peanuts .	1	340.0	peanuts671	21
2452	In the past I have flown on planes serving peanut products and have been fine .	1	337.0	peanuts671	3
2453	I stopped flying on flights serving peanuts after having an asthma attack on a Southwest flight in 2007 .	1	338.0	peanuts671	4
2454	It was not a life-threatening reaction but , to me , further exposure was not worth the risk .	1	338.0	peanuts671	5
2455	( In allergic individuals each allergen exposure results in a faster , more severe reaction the next time they come in contact with the allergen due to antibody production . )	1	348.0	peanuts671	6
2456	So far I have not relied on the government to keep me safe ; I vote with my wallet and pay to fly on airlines that do not serve peanuts ( i.e .	1	339.0	peanuts671	7
2457	American Airlines . )	1	345.0	peanuts671	8
2458	In response to what DOT wants to know : 1 ) I know that there are individuals who are more sensitive to peanut dust than I am .	0		peanuts671	9
2459	In my opinion yes , it is the first need .	0		europolis23	2
2460	One should be able to communicate in this language .	0		europolis23	3
2461	We talk here about tolerance , that we should communicate with the close ones and neighbours and the language is needed to achieve this .	0		europolis23	4
2462	In Holland , we have this approach that everything starts with the language .	1	349.0	europolis23	5

2464	Maybe I will give an example here .	0		europolis37	2
2465	So everyone gets sentimental about these illegal immigrants .	0		europolis37	3
2466	To Poland came in a certain period a whole bunch of Gypsies in order to gather on the streets .	1	350.0	europolis37	4
2467	We had permanent whole pageants of beggars .	1	350.0	europolis37	5
2468	So what we had to do , leave them at the mercy of fate , pat them , or what ?	1	350.0	europolis37	6
2469	So they were expelled to Romania .	1	350.0	europolis37	7
2470	They came to Poland just for begging , so in such cases we must say no and be strict .	1	350.0	europolis37	8
2471	Thank you .	0		europolis37	9
2486	Returning to the immigration topic : I think that for example Poland is scared of immigrants because people are scared that they will take their jobs ; that too many immigrants will come .	1	365.0	europolis36	2
2487	This is mainly the Media ’ s and Polish government ’ s fault .	1	365.0	europolis36	3
2488	They are saying that immigrants are criminals and that they are stealing .	1	365.0	europolis36	4
2489	Of course , sometimes there will be one of them for example from the Post-Soviet country who came illegally and steals .	1	363.0	europolis36	5
2490	The problem is that this one person will commit the crime and his whole nation is blamed for being thieves , killers and so on .	1	366.0	europolis36	6
2491	Surely people in Poland are doing the same bad things : stealing , killing so we can not look at the immigrants from certain countries as bad people which we can not employ in Poland .	1	364.0	europolis36	7
2492	I would like to go back to the issue raised by Frans .	0		europolis22	2
2493	He said that there is a part of the group which is extreme and wants to foist something on us .	0		europolis22	3
2494	In my opinion , Holland has a problem with the legal system as it is not strict – weak , I would say .	0		europolis22	4
2495	So one should consider what to do in order to improve this system and make it more efficient .	0		europolis22	5
2496	If there were some sanctions , or punishments for these or other actions .	0		europolis22	6
2497	When that murder was committed , I think everyone knows it was in Holland , everyone could see that the legal system was not able to impose an appropriate punishment for the guilty .	1	367.0	europolis22	7
2498	So a jurisdiction should be developed , to be more strict .	0		europolis22	8
2499	And I also believe that those fanatics should feel that sanctions could be imposed on them .	0		europolis22	9
2505	That's just a terrible idea .	0		cmv49	10

2516	I believe that cheating is acceptable in the high stress environment that students are placed in today because of higher requirements for entry to college and more and more pressure from society .	0		cmv266	2
2517	CMV I am a senior in high school , and while I dont cheat , I can see why people do it and I don't really have a problem with it .	1	382.0	cmv266	3
2518	I live in California , and the kids at my school take 5 - 6 AP classes junior year and senior year .	1	382.0	cmv266	4
2519	They pay large amounts of money for SAT prep classes , and other resources like this .	1	382.0	cmv266	5
2520	When every kid at your school is so far ahead , an average student who works hard to get B's is left behind and can't keep up .	1	383.0	cmv266	6
2521	So they might resort to cheating to keep up with them .	1	383.0	cmv266	7
2522	And I feel that this is justified because it can be really unfair for those who work their asses off to get that B , only to have their application to a better college rejected because people keep pushing this envelope of cramming more and more AP classes into their schedule .	1	388.0	cmv266	8
2523	So when it comes down to it in my opinion , when someone's hardest and best effort wont get them somewhere because of the unfair competition they face , cheating is justified . thanks in advance for your replies !	0		cmv266	9

2528	As it comes to economic immigration , it concerns the labour rights , so we cannot let them not being adhered .	0		europolis26	2
2529	That is why such illegal practices should be fought against .	0		europolis26	3
2530	Those who are willing to be paid less than a given countries average wage , but higher than in their countries . . hmm . .	0		europolis26	4

2532	I do not think that there is any benefit , neither for them nor for countries .	0		europolis26	6
2533	In Belgium , and also in my town , there were employers on whom penalties were imposed for employing illegal immigrants .	1	390.0	europolis26	7

2535	It is not about the religion because this is completely neutral for me , in what somebody believe in .	0		europolis32	10
2536	However , some elements of their culture are contradictory to democracy in our European approach and sometimes I am scared of this .	0		europolis32	11
2537	I would like to say that Muslims are people and people are different .	0		europolis32	2
2538	I have been living for one year in Köln , I was studying , and there are plenty of Muslims .	1	394.0	europolis32	3
2539	In fact , some of them assimilate themselves and were normally taking part in classes , they were also my neighbours , but there was something that scared me a lot in their culture .	1	394.0	europolis32	4
2540	For example , at the beach we could see a man without any clothes and his wife fully dressed up , sweaty and she couldn ’ t show her face .	1	395.0	europolis32	5
2541	Other example , I had a friend which was saying that she would never marry a guy which is not Turkish .	1	396.0	europolis32	6
2542	She has been living there for 20 years and could never change her mind because this is exactly what her parents want to .	1	396.0	europolis32	7
2543	The thing that scares me most is the women ’ s role in their culture .	0		europolis32	8
2544	The fact that they do not have any rights , that they can not show their faces .	0		europolis32	9
2545	No , I'm just an allergy sufferer ( but not to peanuts or tree nuts ) like most of the population .	1	405.0	peanuts503	2
2546	The difference is that I actually know a good number of people in the airline industry as well as reading lots of research papers on the subject of peanut allergies .	1	405.0	peanuts503	3
2547	I tire of the constant harping that peanut allergies are on the rise , when there is no scientific data to back it up .	0		peanuts503	4
2548	I do believe that people need to educate themselves as to what is a real allergy , rather than simply an adverse reaction to a particular food .	0		peanuts503	5
2549	Far too often , people ( especially parents ) quickly label an adverse reaction as an allergy , without testing them to be certain .	1	406.0	peanuts503	6
2550	Then they hammer away at the child that they can't have certain foods or have to be REALLY CAREFUL or they'll die .	1	406.0	peanuts503	7
2551	That creates needless anxiety for the child and causes a great deal of psychological damage to them .	1	406.0	peanuts503	8
2552	Well , maybe there is a solution .	0		europolis27	2
2553	A specific situation , for instance plumber or painter from Poland is a self-employed person .	1	409.0	europolis27	3

2563	& gt ; I know it's a terrible view and again I want to apologise , but does it physically hurt men to be raped by women ( as in PIV sex ) ?	0		cmv307	11
2564	Again , rape has little or nothing to do with physical damage .	0		cmv307	12
2565	Also , keep in mind not all rape of men by women would have to be vaginal sex .	0		cmv307	13
2566	Oral ( either giving or receiving ) or anal rape ( pegging ) are also possible . so there is potential for physical damage even if that mattered .	0		cmv307	14
2567	& gt ; I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs , always thinking about sex , always wanting it , etc .	0		cmv307	15
2568	"I mean I have male friends who I've spoke to about this who believe men can't be raped too ( they deemed it "" ridiculous "" ) ."	1	419.0	cmv307	16

2577	Women are that way too , but thanks to what I'm about to discuss they are more circumspect about it .	0		cmv307	24
2578	So , on to why society sucks : Men are told to be a man , they have to be virile .	1	417.0	cmv307	25
2579	And that means having as much sex as you can . on the other side , women are told they have to be demure , and ladylike , and not sleep with as many people as possible .	1	417.0	cmv307	26
2580	Thanks to those two stereotypes , men feel like they * have * to think about sex constantly , and women act like they aren't allowed to think about it !	1	417.0	cmv307	27
2581	Thankfully those stereotypes are fading , but it will take time before they are gone for good .	1	421.0	cmv307	28

2589	Thanks to views like that ( no offense ) , men who are raped are far less likely than a woman to report it ( and let me assure you the vast majority of female rapes go unreported , so that says something ) .	0		cmv307	35
2590	I hate to sound like a jerk but um . . . do you actually know what rape is ?	0		cmv307	4

2672	As I suffer from a severe peanut allergy , I am also for the banning of peanut products on airplanes .	1	464.0	peanuts688	2
2673	I can assure you that this is a very important issue ; I myself had reactions to airborne peanuts while on airplanes .	1	464.0	peanuts688	3
2674	This makes traveling by air very risky if not impossible .	1	467.0	peanuts688	4
2675	It is important that the general public be made aware of the lifestyle restrictions that this situation puts on those who suffer from the allergy .	0		peanuts688	5
2676	For example , being unable to travel by air can have a significant impact on professional development and career success .	0		peanuts688	6

2707	The simple fact is that a peanut allergy is life threatening and should not be compared to other intolerances or allergies that are not .	0		peanuts298	10
2708	Doing so is naive and bordering on ignorant .	0		peanuts298	11
2709	Balancing both the seriousness and scope of the threat involved against what could only be described as a petty inconvenince associated with banning peanuts and peanut products , the choice seems clear .	0		peanuts298	12
2710	That is , unless the peanut lobby or ill-informed airline passengers are making decisions in Washington .	0		peanuts298	13
2711	I commend the DOT for being on top of this issue and urge the adoption of a final rule banning peanuts and peanut products from airplans .	0		peanuts298	14
2712	As the father of a three year old daughter who was recently diagnosed with a life-threatening peanut allergy , I fully support a ban on peanuts and food containing peanuts .	1	483.0	peanuts298	2
2713	While my daughter does not have an inhalation allergy , she is extremely sensitive and if she ingested even a minute particle of peanut protein , she could have a life threatening reaction .	1	483.0	peanuts298	3
2714	While we have epi pens and benadryl to administer in the event of such an event , those medications are only a short term response and immediate medical care is essential .	1	483.0	peanuts298	4
2715	As a parent , it is my job to insure she does not ingest anything that will cause a reaction and we do everything we can to create a large buffer between her and such products .	1	487.0	peanuts298	5
2716	That said , we have little control over the environment in an airplane .	1	488.0	peanuts298	6
2717	Others eating peanuts nearby or even someone having eaten a peanut on an earlier flight could create a very real problem .	1	484.0	peanuts298	7
2718	While we can do everything possible to clean the area in which we sit and diligently parent her while on the flight , the risk is significant .	1	484.0	peanuts298	8
2719	Moreover , with the number of children diagnosed with peanut allergies having tripled between 1997 and 2007 ( see recent Mount Sinai study ) this threat is neither extremely limited nor decreasing .	0		peanuts298	9

2728	Secondly , it is hard to train unqualified person into an engineer .	1	489.0	europolis24	7
2729	Currently , there has been a deficit in Belgium , and we needed about 1000 engineers .	1	489.0	europolis24	8

2733	Few years ago in Italy there was a first official case about it .	1	493.0	europolis30	2
2734	They gave jobs to a big amount of immigrants and let them stay in Italy .	1	493.0	europolis30	3
2735	So many immigrants from France and Germany came to Italy .	1	493.0	europolis30	4
2736	So I do not think that such a big procedure of legalizing immigrants is the best idea and solution .	1	496.0	europolis30	5
2737	Such people should be integrated in the society .	1	496.0	europolis30	6

2743	"If you're going to ban peanuts , someone better step up the regulation of the junk that is passed off as "" food "" on planes ."	0		peanuts662	12
2744	I think the better solution to this problem is to have people who have airborne peanut allergies declare themselves when they book the flight ( with medical proof ) and place restrictions ONLY on that flight , with the rule that all other passengers be notified at check-in of the special service and the airline should offer passengers pretzels or something else on that flight .	0		peanuts662	13

2752	It is that simple .	0		peanuts662	7

2897	so , once you ban peanuts and tree nuts , will you prohibit seeing eye dogs on flights for those of us who are severly allergic ?	1	572.0	peanuts283	38
2898	Remember , you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal . or , will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier , check on your medications , where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions .	1	572.0	peanuts283	39

2910	I'm not sure why you continue to question the potential severity of peanut allergies .	0		peanuts651	11
2911	There's a very large body of medical documentation establishing , quite thoroughly , just how severe these allergies can be and others on this site have mentioned that nut allergies account for the majority of food-allergy caused death .	1	579.0	peanuts651	12

2914	Perhaps we've just been lucky so far .	1	580.0	peanuts651	15
2915	From what I've gathered reading the comments here , people with peanut allergies severe enough to warrant immediate medical attention , because of their fears , do not generally fly on airplanes .	0		peanuts651	16
2916	Very small population to begin with + widespread self-imposed flying ban = No deaths , YET , on an airplane .	0		peanuts651	17

2918	The problem , right now , isn't people dying of anaphylaxis on airplanes , it's American citizens being unable , because of their disability , to participate in a normal , every day activity that they otherwise would be able to , with minor accommodation .	0		peanuts651	19
2919	Try a Google search .	0		peanuts651	2
2920	I do agree with you that banning peanuts ( and , really , all nuts ) on flights is not the right way to go .	0		peanuts651	20
2921	Instead of worrying about one particular person and what motivation they may or may not have had in ignoring your first recommendation of it , why not help the overall cause here by continuing to advocate that airlines provide , upon request , masks , gloves , and cleanroom suits so that those who DO take responsibility for their own condition can enjoy the freedom air travel provides the rest of us US citizens .	0		peanuts651	21
2922	I very quickly found a link to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America that contends that under both the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 that allergies and asthma are both recognized disabilities .	0		peanuts651	3

2924	Whether or not the federal government has specifically ruled on this , I don't know .	0		peanuts651	5
2925	Did you find any court rulings opposed to this position ?	0		peanuts651	6
2926	If the courts simply haven't addressed this yet , which , frankly , seems unlikely considering how many organizations and websites I've found that reference successful cases of workplace discrimination under the ADA for individuals with allergies , the fact is , when they do , they almost certainly will ( or at least should ) recognize this as a conditional disability qualifying under the ADA for the reasons above .	0		peanuts651	7
2927	As I understand it , the concern is not over trace amounts of oil and dust that have been absorbed or trapped by fabric , it's over the clouds of fresh dust that are released when a package is opened and dispersed throughout the plane via the central air system or from the overhead air jets .	0		peanuts651	8

2939	On to your point about how we are perceived in society : you have never known societal discomfort until you have lived a day with Gender Dysphoria .	1	590.0	cmv109	12
2940	Hearing ' ma'am ' or ' miss ' all day every day is the kind of thing that can just make you want to lay down and die as a transgender person .	1	590.0	cmv109	13
2941	It may seem shallow and unnecessary to pander to what society expects of us but there are two reasons for it : one is that stereotypes are absolutely based in fact—they are really just a variation on what psychologists call ' schemas ' or really quick bullet points about something that your brain can pull out at the mention of a word .	0		cmv109	14
2942	Basically all those little pictures we get in our mind when someone says ' little old lady ' or ' Scotsman ' .	1	602.0	cmv109	15
2943	The reason these exist is that they are based on truth and are your brain's way of saving a bit of time because memorising each individual aspect of each individual little old lady or Scotsman you meet is a daunting task .	1	595.0	cmv109	16
2944	These are only detrimental if we grow to rely on them too much and don't allow them to adapt or expect everyone to fit accurately into our schema which will accurately describe only a handful of people .	1	596.0	cmv109	17
2945	So basically gender roles are a schema : girls do this , boys do that .	0		cmv109	18
2946	My little notecards in my noggin say so—and they are absolutely accurate as a * generalisation * which is why you will find that many trans people do fit these stereotypes of their true gender well .	1	597.0	cmv109	19
2947	You're generally right—it is stereotyping to assume that someone is of a certain gender based on what activities they enjoy and it isn't accurate .	0		cmv109	2
2948	Some things fit people and others don't but as a whole we don't do a half bad job of distinguishing girls and boys ( assuming we don't argue that these ideas are set in stone ) .	1	597.0	cmv109	20
2949	Equally , there are people on the absolute opposite end of the spectrum : outliers who don't fit into any of their gender's roles .	0		cmv109	21
2950	This doesn't make their dysphoria and need to transition any less valid .	0		cmv109	22
2951	If you can't tell from my previous points , I strongly disagree with the war on gender roles : used correctly there is absolutely nothing wrong with them ( they should , of course , never be forced on someone against their will ) .	0		cmv109	23
2952	They exist for a reason , that reason being that they are fairly prevalent and our brain has decided ' Aha , I should file that ! '	0		cmv109	24
2953	However , that doesn't mean that there isn't a huge spectrum in between .	0		cmv109	25
2954	It's just a basic starting point for what our brain associates with men and women .	0		cmv109	26
2955	The second reason is that , for our emotional well-being , us trans folks absolutely * need * to be gendered correctly .	0		cmv109	27
2956	It is pivotal to our survival .	0		cmv109	28
2957	As such , there is a huge need to ' pass ' within the trans community : the easiest way to do this is to dress and act ways that are typical of the gender they want to be seen as .	0		cmv109	29
2958	However , that isn't really how it works .	0		cmv109	3
2959	It is a sad fact that people make brash judgments based on what we wear and how we present ourselves ; however , getting the average person who has never thought about gender in their life to consider that gender is really on the inside and not the outside is going to be a long and hard battle .	1	598.0	cmv109	30
2960	As such , it is just easier to conform ( and realistically it is not viable for a trans man wearing make up and showing their breasts to be seen as male to the general population—whether it should be or not is controversial even within the trans community ) .	0		cmv109	31
2961	So basically , in my opinion , it is not that a person who fits female stereotypes * must * be a woman or that a person who fits male stereotypes * must * be a man : it is that these people are women / men and as such align with some ( but generally not all ) of the tropes of their gender because they are rooted , to some extent , in truth .	0		cmv109	32
2962	I hope this is somewhat useful to you—I'm running on no sleep so if there's anything convoluted you want me to clarify or you want me to answer other , more specific questions , then go right ahead !	0		cmv109	33

3331	Moreover , the courts have a statistically demonstrable tendency to simply not charge rich people , and on the rare occasion rich people do get into legal trouble they get lighter sentences than poor people ( if for no other reason than that rich people can afford really great lawyers , while poor people get overworked public defenders ) .	1	810.0	cmv218	11
3332	Further , we have historic evidence that the last time it was tried , mandatory sterilization was directed mainly against the poor and black .	1	810.0	cmv218	12
3333	Given all that , I would argue that the social problems caused by legally mandating sterilization are going to outweigh the benefits of having fewer children abused or neglected .	0		cmv218	13
3334	I don't like that .	0		cmv218	14
3335	I honestly wish I could support mandatory sterilization because I've seen firsthand what happens when people unfit for parenthood keep having kids .	1	806.0	cmv218	15
3336	I will say that I think the better solution is reality based , age appropriate , sex ed in schools , starting at kindergarten and continuing through graduation .	1	812.0	cmv218	16
3337	And easily available free contraception .	1	812.0	cmv218	17
3338	Because the truth is that most of the people who are having kids they abuse and neglect don't really want kids in the first place .	1	812.0	cmv218	18
3339	"This also isn't speculation , in nations where sex ed is better , and contraception is more affordable or paid for by the government , the rate of child abuse and neglect is lower than in the USA . [ 1 ] I say "" one "" because another of the big stated purposes of the America's foray into court ordered sterilization was eugenics . [ 2 ] Example : the majority of people arrested for possession of marijuana are black , despite the fact that every study done to date has shown that black people use marijuana at a significantly lower rate than white people ."	1	812.0	cmv218	19
3340	I'd argue that the problem with this is that while it makes a certain sort of sense , history shows that it would be applied for bad purposes and that the solution proposed causes more problems than it solves .	1	807.0	cmv218	2
3341	All things being equal , you'd expect the majority of arrests for possession of marijuana to be white ( not only are whites the majority , but they use pot more frequently ) .	1	813.0	cmv218	20
3342	Yet black people get arrested for it more than white people . [ 3 ] Black people get sentences about 60% longer , on average , than white people who committed the same crime .	1	813.0	cmv218	21
3343	This isn't speculation , but rather the only conclusion that can be drawn from the USA's prior history of judicially mandated sterilization .	1	807.0	cmv218	3
3344	One of the stated purposes [ 1 ] of the program was to prevent harm to children by rendering sterile those people who had demonstrated themselves to be abusive or neglectful to their children .	1	807.0	cmv218	4
3345	In practice what happened was that the program was used to sterilize as many poor white people and black people as the law could manage ( even when there was no evidence of abuse or neglect ) , and that rich white people were simply not forcibly sterilized even when abundant evidence of abuse existed .	1	807.0	cmv218	5
3346	I don't at all like the idea of people with a past history of neglect and abuse having kids .	1	805.0	cmv218	6
3347	And I'm not speaking abstrctly here , I've got relatives who are abusive and neglectful towards their children ( CPS has taken them away , and quite rightly so ) and they keep having more children ( which CPS can't take away until they manage to gather evidence of abuse and / or neglect , so the newborn has a month or three living with horrible people before CPS can do it's job and get the kids out ) .	1	805.0	cmv218	7
3348	If there were ever candidates for forcible sterilization , I know two personally and agree 100% that in a perfect world they would not be allowed to reproduce .	1	809.0	cmv218	8

3621	To me , that's just the right to not be annoyed .	0		cmv41429	10
3622	But let's talk about the right to be completely left alone - - the right to not deal with society at all , ever .	0		cmv41429	11
3623	In other words , do we , as humans , have the right from birth to not participate or be beholden to any social / national / economic / legal structure , AND the right to realistically act on that ?	0		cmv41429	12
3624	I believe the answer is YES , and any answer other than YES , at least in the current state of the world , is basically an endorsement of human rights violations .	0		cmv41429	13
3625	Here is why .	0		cmv41429	14
3626	I was never asked to join this planet , nor was I asked which of many options of nationality to choose from ( in fact , as a fully grown adult , I still can't freely choose this ) .	1	951.0	cmv41429	15
3627	I wasn't even asked whether I wanted to be a part of - - and thus tacitly approve of - - the whole nation-state structure that has been established .	1	951.0	cmv41429	16
3628	As it stands , I have no option but to agree to participate in the idea of nations , laws , global economies , currency , etc . , which I am essentially coerced into doing by legal penalty , no matter where in the world I am .	1	952.0	cmv41429	17
3629	"This is true because every habitable place on this planet has been claimed as "" property "" within the jurisdiction of some social structure , leaving me no place to physically inhabit without being subjected to another's rules / society / economy - - none of which I have any desire to participate in ."	1	952.0	cmv41429	18
3630	"I can on some practical level , opt out and live "" illegally "" on some land somewhere out of sight , but this cannot come with full peace of mind , as there will always be some looming threat of legal consequence to failure to comply with the laws of the territory I am living in ( e.g . trespassing ) ."	1	952.0	cmv41429	19
3631	I'm not sure anyone has actually convinced me to change my view thus far , though you've done well at arguing that what I'm talking about can't happen / is not a good idea for me to try / it's been shown that such an idea can't work .	0		cmv41429	2
3632	But wait , you might say , there's a workaround .	1	952.0	cmv41429	20
3633	You can buy a small piece of land and live there in isolation without ever dealing with society .	1	952.0	cmv41429	21
3634	But I don't think so .	1	952.0	cmv41429	22
3635	First of all , I have to participate in some economy I don't believe in before I can even buy that land .	1	952.0	cmv41429	23
3636	This means that I have to get a job , get a car , do all the things that make us all miserable , and participate in an economy I never asked to be a part of just so I can opt out !	1	952.0	cmv41429	24
3637	Then after that , I would have to pay property taxes on that land every year .	1	952.0	cmv41429	25
3638	Thus , I am continually forced back into participating in an economy that I want no part in just to pay for the land that I need to escape it .	1	952.0	cmv41429	26
3639	"The way I read this is that even the "" workaround "" to the essential problem posed in the previous paragraph forces me to participate in all these systems before I can even exercise the right to leave , and then once I do exercise my right to leave , the structures still force me to be bound to it ."	1	952.0	cmv41429	27
3640	In other words , I have no viable means of escape . . . . which means that I am a slave , and my human rights are being continually violated .	1	952.0	cmv41429	28
3641	Change my view .	0		cmv41429	29

3643	In other words , you've gotten me to agree at the practical level , but no one has yet convinced me at the theoretical level , though some of you have tried to argue that my question is flawed , and that the law of being a part of a social system is literally inviolable , like laws of physics , which I'm afraid I don't buy . * * To start , let me state that I'm not a libertarian , and I identify fairly strongly as a liberal .	1	949.0	cmv41429	4
3644	I also do not identify with any militia or secessionist movements , and I'm not anti-government per se .	1	950.0	cmv41429	5

3667	I would love to see consumers use a form letter prepared by the CFPB which spells out a variety of disputes and helps them articulate the dispute better .	0		cdcp182	10
3668	I do think one of the toughest hurdles for a collector ( and one of the biggest complaints from persons against whom collection efforts are made ) is when they get a person that states the debt is not theirs ( but someone else's ) with the same name .	1	970.0	cdcp182	11
3669	We do our homework on our end to investigate ( we'll attempt to compare the last 4 digits of the social , we may run a skip trace to see if party we contacted lived at the address on the statements , etc and we will provide verification , but in a mobile world investigating that the John Smith you contacted is the same John Smith you are attempting to resolve a debt with can prove tricky .	1	964.0	cdcp182	12
3670	This is especially tricky if there is NEVER indication that we have reached the wrong person .	1	970.0	cdcp182	13
3671	We never wish to contact the wrong party regarding a debt , but it unfortunately happens because consumers don't always relay updated contacted information to creditors and a collector then has to rely upon the best information available to them .	1	968.0	cdcp182	14
3672	Unfortunately , I don't know what the fix is here .	0		cdcp182	15
3673	Despite the stories to the contrary , it simply is not the intent of any professional and responsible collection agency or firm to attempt collections from a party that does not owe the debt , but this is a hard one to address without good communication from the wrongly contacted party and the collector .	0		cdcp182	16
3674	Many disputes are difficult to investigate because it is unclear what the consumer's dispute actually is .	1	969.0	cdcp182	2
3675	If the consumer is specific enough so that there is a clear item to research , we will do so .	1	965.0	cdcp182	3
3676	"However , its a vague dispute such as "" I dispute this debt "" or "" I don't owe this debt "" ( which is incredibly common ) , then we will provide statements or a contract to attempt to address it ."	1	965.0	cdcp182	4
3677	The amount of the investigation is largely lead by the amount of detail the consumer relays , and most of it results in us relying on the documentation the creditor provides to resolve the dispute .	1	969.0	cdcp182	5
3678	Sometimes we may need to ask the creditor to research their records for indication of X , Y , or Z , but most the time the dispute isn't that specific .	1	966.0	cdcp182	6
3679	I find in my practice that we will often ask a consumer to provide information to support their dispute ( such as proof of payment ) , but then the consumer does not provide it , and we are stuck in our efforts to investigate further .	1	963.0	cdcp182	7
3680	"Requiring only a "" reasonable "" investigation without further definition sounds like a punt to the courts to decide the defintion after a lot of litigation ."	0		cdcp182	8

3689	Really , the reasons to become vegetarian / vegan are so compelling ( health , environment , ethics , even enjoyment of eating ) , it's hard to believe more people aren't considering it .	1	978.0	veganism44	11
3690	Five years ago , I drastically cut back my consumption of meat and animal products .	1	975.0	veganism44	2
3691	This was mostly for selfish reasons - my health .	1	975.0	veganism44	3
3692	My new way of eating took some getting used to , and required a lot of effort learning how to cook tasty meat-free dishes .	1	975.0	veganism44	4

3695	I love my whole foods , plant-based diet and will never go back .	1	975.0	veganism44	7
3696	There's plenty of evidence to show that reducing meat and dairy consumption has health benefits ( reduced heart disease , stroke , diabetes , etc ) .	1	978.0	veganism44	8

3698	In a religiously diverse society , favoritism would destroy respect for the country's new political institutions .	0		veganism50	2
3699	In practice , of course , a kind of generic Christianity did violate the wall between church and state , which is why Supreme Court decisions in the 1960s banning Bible-reading and officially-sponsored prayer in public schools unleashed such a storm of controversy.But in the21st century Pew research polls have documented a steady decline in the proportion of the population that identifies with any branch of Christianity .	1	979.0	veganism50	3

3943	First of all , I'm not aware of any law that compels a 3rd party to provide current contact information for a debtor , so even if they do know where that debtor is , they don't deserve to be harassed daily for months or years as punishment for not offering up that information .	0		cdcp230	4

4228	The sheets are what gets dirty and require frequent laundering if you're sleeping responsibly .	0		cmv36367	4
4229	Now I'll make concessions for people who sweat profusely , commonly wake up wrapped in your duvet or if it obviously becomes dirty through . . . other . . . means .	1	1263.0	cmv36367	5
4230	If you're the kind of person who changes their bedfellows frequently , then yeah , by all means , wash that stank off .	1	1264.0	cmv36367	6
4231	For the responsible sleeper , minimal contact with the duvet is made and should not warrant washing other than the regular buildup of grime that any throw blanket that never leaves the back of . . . some chair in your house or something .	0		cmv36367	7
4232	Plus the things are a pain in the ass to fold .	1	1265.0	cmv36367	8
4233	Yeah , I've seen the duvet burrito video , it still sucks to put back in commission after washing .	1	1265.0	cmv36367	9
4234	And in reality , if a debt collector / debt owner can not resolve their clients issues within the already established SOL of each state , then extending the SOL or having a national SOL under which to bring suit does nothing but allow debt collectors to continue to harass consumers .	0		cdcp294	10
4235	Three years really is more than enough time to sue .	0		cdcp294	11
4236	Just as criminal defendants are entitled to a quick and speedy trail , so should consumers who may / may not be aware they have an outstanding debt .	0		cdcp294	12
4237	That is to say : having a national SOL is a guise to prolong resolution rather than a more quick a final resolve in when to bring suit .	0		cdcp294	13
4238	I would disagree that there is confusion among consumers about SOL which would , as you suggest , require the need for a national SOL .	0		cdcp294	2
4239	The only time I have personally seen SOL straddle a line is when a consumer moves to another state with a different SOL .	1	1266.0	cdcp294	3
4240	The clarity needs to be in these such cases .	1	1267.0	cdcp294	4
4241	Because once a debtor moves , both parties claim the SOL where it benefits them for their desired outcome .	1	1267.0	cdcp294	5
4242	A national SOL only benefits the debt collectors and not the consumers .	0		cdcp294	6
4243	The focus should remain on creating , as best as possible , a win-win solution that benefits the debt collectors the consumers .	0		cdcp294	7
4244	Having a national SOL of 7 years as ACA International wants compromises state laws wherein some states of SOL of 3 years ( and otherwise less than 7 ) .	0		cdcp294	8

4504	Occasionally people end up getting thrown outside of the car if windows are open ( I've seen this happen in person ) , and can even crash through closed windows , and could be a danger to other people in other vehicles .	1	1368.0	cmv47594	14

4947	So I was an atheist until about two months ago , when I suddenly had a change of view ( haha ) .	1	1562.0	cmv47056	2
4948	But then I saw this ( long ) video : It really made me think about Christianity in a way I hadn't before .	1	1562.0	cmv47056	3
4949	I had been very liberal but I was slowly turning more and more to the right , so I actually sought that video out to help that process .	1	1562.0	cmv47056	4
4950	In the end I got a lot more .	1	1562.0	cmv47056	5
4951	I sort of had a . . . feeling , both mental and almost even physical , that seemed to me like what people probably talk about when they say they ' found Jesus ' .	1	1562.0	cmv47056	6
4952	So I spent about a week or two full of invective , until it sort of petered out .	1	1562.0	cmv47056	7
4953	At this point I feel like I could go either way , the very definition of agnostic I guess .	1	1562.0	cmv47056	8
4954	In a way I think I'd like to move towards Christ rather than away though . . .	1	1562.0	cmv47056	9
4966	I do my own washing and often shop for my parents and have payed for meals out and the like .	1	1574.0	cmv24123	10
4967	I also pay rent to them but much less than 1 / 4 of what I'd pay for renting my own property .	1	1574.0	cmv24123	11
4968	I don't feel like I'm scrounging in any way and they're financially better off with me living at home .	1	1574.0	cmv24123	12
4969	Obviously I don't want to live here forever and if I was dating in a serious relationship I'd move in with her .	1	1574.0	cmv24123	13
4970	But in my present situation I really can't think of any reason why I'd spend 80% of my salary on moving out rather than to save it for the future at home .	1	1574.0	cmv24123	14
4971	I don't spend a lot of money so it's all going into savings .	1	1574.0	cmv24123	15

4974	But considering how much a large part of Reddit believe this lifestyle is literally worse than Hitler , I wanted some counter opinions on it .	0		cmv24123	18
4975	I admit that living at home at 30 with kids and no job forcing your parents to raise your children for you is very irresponsible .	0		cmv24123	19

4977	But I feel given the right responsible circumstances living at home can be a good thing for both parent and child .	0		cmv24123	20
4978	Although it might be due to a high percentage of Americans and British culture is different .	0		cmv24123	3
4979	But I want a different view anyway since all my friends think what I'm doing is fine .	0		cmv24123	4
4980	I'm an only child if that changes anything .	1	1572.0	cmv24123	5
4981	Long story short is I got employment after university with a different university that happens to be about 4 miles from my parents home .	1	1573.0	cmv24123	6
4982	I couldn't realistically move much closer due to how the roads are around me that lead to the University require you to take a main road which is near my house .	1	1573.0	cmv24123	7
4983	So without that motivation I've never seen the point to move out .	1	1573.0	cmv24123	8

5004	The consumer can list whatever numbers or information they want and the business or entity must consider it to be truthful .	1	1598.0	cdcp164	5
5005	Often the only way to determine if the information is accurate is to make a phone call .	1	1598.0	cdcp164	6
5006	I've received these calls myself .	1	1594.0	cdcp164	7
5007	Depending on how much debt and how many business or entities have extended credit may be a factor on how often third parties are contacted .	0		cdcp164	8

5009	I decided to try Impossible brand ’ s “ fake ground beef ” over the weekend .	1	1599.0	veganism4	2
5010	I mistakenly treated it like real ground beef and put it in a searing hot pan with a bit grape seed oil and did NOT move it thinking I would get a crust .	1	1599.0	veganism4	3
5011	I also cooked it to 160 degrees which is what the package recommended .	1	1599.0	veganism4	4

5039	It has also made me paranoid about my own finances .	1	1616.0	cdcp165	11
5040	I have been a frequent target of debt collectors and their phone calls for several years .	1	1614.0	cdcp165	2

31	I am a person who is SEVERELY allergic and the passenger beside me who accepted the peanuts , hearing about my concern , could have cared less that his neighbor ( me ) was covering her nose with her sleeve for the entire 3hr flight with an inhaler in hand .	1	1645.0	peanuts216	3

278	Welcome to my world as a severe peanut allergy sufferer and airline Captain .	1	1759.0	peanuts403	3
279	I have been dealing with this for over 22 years !	1	1759.0	peanuts403	4
280	I am yearning for the day ( to return for the airline I work for as they had discontinued serving them for a few years only to declare the substitute , almonds , was too expensive and brought back peanuts ) that I do not have to tell , an incredulous , flight attendant that I need a peanut free zone if I have to travel in the cabin !	1	1760.0	peanuts403	5
281	Practically how can a peanut ban be enforced ?	0		peanuts1051	2
282	I eat a lot of peanut products and travel with peanut butter M & M's as there are many things I do not eat and I find them to be a a great snack , that does not go off after a few days .	1	1763.0	peanuts1051	3
283	The only problem is that sometimes the bag opens and so their are crumbs at the bottom of my bags and maybe my hangs are not so clean when I opened the zipper and so on .	1	1763.0	peanuts1051	4
284	If I was told last minute I cannot take my peanut butter products on board will the airline have to make sure they have suitable alternative snacks available for me to eat ?	1	1766.0	peanuts1051	5
285	Surely the highly allergic peanut people will be at risk from the peanut crumbs / dust on my clothes and hands ( which may have brushed their headrest as I walked past ) ?	1	1766.0	peanuts1051	6

337	Even the smell of peanuts makes me want to be sick .	1	1795.0	peanuts673	3
338	The fact the entire plane opens their peanuts at once , makes it an overpowering smell that just unsettles me and makes me nervous .	1	1795.0	peanuts673	4
339	I just can't see air travelers really loving peanuts so much that 1 ) it is their preferred snack , and 2 ) they are willing to eat it at the expense of another person's suffering .	1	1797.0	peanuts673	5
340	I do fly Southwest a lot and tell them of my allergy , and they are pretty good about banning peanuts from that flight .	1	1796.0	peanuts673	6

439	I can't touch the black belts in Kumite , even the ones that are 5 years younger than me and have far shorter arms .	1	1847.0	cmv288	11
440	No one is expected to perfectly execute what they're taught , but in being taught the canned moves , they learn what the moves should look like , how they work , and what they're supposed to do , and in that they can use them more effectively , in their own way , in real combat .	0		cmv288	12
441	While I may not bring my hand all the way up and strike exactly at the collarbone with a shuto sakotsu uchi , I'll certainly instinctively form my hand into the right position , bring my hand as high as time constraints allow me to do , and then strike more effectively at the area I know my strike will be most effective .	1	1848.0	cmv288	13
442	None of that will be exactly proper form , just as you'll most likely never use the exact same moves that you see in those videos .	0		cmv288	14
443	But the things you do learn do allow you to know the general move , and utilize it for your purpose when you can .	0		cmv288	15
444	Watching a couple videos will obviously not be enough to give you an adequate measure of self-defense ability .	0		cmv288	16
445	But canned techniques , when adequately practiced , can definitely help in a real life situation .	0		cmv288	17
446	Karate student here .	1	1847.0	cmv288	2
447	We have a few types of learning , and we learn the canned moves .	1	1847.0	cmv288	3
448	We learn how to perfectly execute a shuto sakotsu uchi , a downward knife hand strike .	1	1847.0	cmv288	4
449	We learn how to do a perfectly formed inside middle block .	1	1847.0	cmv288	5
450	"We even hold separate courses on "" street self-defense "" , teaching how to get out of holds and what to do in what situation ."	1	1847.0	cmv288	6
451	However , when it comes to Kumite , fighting , all of that goes away .	1	1847.0	cmv288	7
452	No one pays attention to proper form , they just block , strike , and dodge .	1	1847.0	cmv288	8
453	But does this mean that all the technical learning didn't help ?	1	1847.0	cmv288	9
530	I agree with you Vec .	0		peanuts314	2
531	I am severely allergic to cats which leads to many of the same symptoms that people with peanut allergies have ( tightness in the chest , the feeling of their throat closing ) for me these symptoms are made more severe because I also have asthma , which kicks in when I am around cats - airway constriction , uncontrollable coughing etc .	1	1872.0	peanuts314	3
532	From reading some of the post I understand that the argument has been made that peanuts should be banned because people can die of a peanut allergy .	0		peanuts314	4
533	I also believe that animals should also be banned then because people who are allergic and or have asthma could also die if they are on an extended flight with an animal they are allergic to .	0		peanuts314	5
534	According to the CDC the number of Asthma related deaths was 3,616 in 2006 .	0		peanuts314	6
535	All FPS games seem pretty much the same to me with slight variations , and RPGs seem to just be getting more mainstream and accessible .	1	1877.0	cmv138	10
536	I would like to get rid of this prejudice , because I really enjoy playing video games , I just haven't found a game I genuinely thought was a masterpiece since I've played dark souls .	1	1881.0	cmv138	11
537	So please , CMV and maybe suggest some titles you think Id enjoy	0		cmv138	12

540	Please CMV The title says it all , and I understand its rather specific .	0		cmv138	4
541	To me , Dark Souls has the perfect amount of challenge blended with in-depth character development in the most beautiful video game world Ive ever seen .	1	1878.0	cmv138	5
542	"The game doesn't necessarily have the best graphics possible , but the seamless design of the world and the gorgeous views make me say "" wow "" much more than a game like skyrim , farcry 3 , bioshock infinite , or last of us does ."	1	1875.0	cmv138	6
543	Since Ive gotten into dark souls I havent been able to really enjoy any other RPG / adventure games because they simply seem inadequate and childish in comparison to DS .	1	1876.0	cmv138	7
544	This CMV applies more to new games than old ones , because I certainly still love the games I used to love such as Morrowind , Metroid Prime , Soul Calibur , etc .	1	1877.0	cmv138	8
545	But dark souls made feel that new games have nothing innovative or redeemable in them .	1	1877.0	cmv138	9
580	By the way , once I got off the plane where I was asked to put my personal stash of peanut-containing trail mix away , I did some research on airborn food allergy because I was skeptical .	1	1899.0	peanuts648	2

606	How can we accept religion with democracy where all the people should have equal rights : to vote ; to assume any outfit , to our own mindedness ?	0		europolis33	7

710	Thank you .	0		europolis18	5
711	Your reasoning is faulty because the food industry is just as profit driven as any other industry that means that they will produce whatever we as consumers will buy .	0		cmv310	2
712	If we eat less meat and more vegitarian then eventually the demand for vegitarian alternatives will cause the food industry to focus more on vegitarian food and less on industrialised meat production .	0		cmv310	3
713	And eventhough the restaurant you go to won't stop buying meat because your friend ordered a sallad it will change it's menu if they see a change in what people order and if enough restaurants change their menus then the food industry will change their production .	0		cmv310	4
714	No one person can change the world all we can do is change ourselves and hope that others follow .	0		cmv310	5
715	Where I come from things are already changing we have more vegitarian restaurants now than we had 10 years ago , we have an active debate about meat consumption , schools introduced vegitarian options and now some public schools are introducing meat free mondays .	1	1941.0	cmv310	6

937	Obama is the best we could do 2008 - 2013 and complaining about his presidency is pointless , CMV .	0		cmv135	2
938	"I know a lot of people complain about Obama and hate on him , even the fairly "" liberal "" people ."	0		cmv135	3
939	However , in the US , realistically , Democrats and Republicans are the only ones that are capable of taking the seat in the Oval Office due our ( seemingly ) two party system .	0		cmv135	4

1033	Because to truly eliminate any potential for airborne peanut ( for the moment , let's ignore whether that poses a real risk or not ) , passengers would not be able to bring any food on-board , because even home-made sandwiches could contain nuts .	0		peanuts734	6
1034	And personally , I don't think you can go that far .	0		peanuts734	7
1035	And so far on this comment board , no one has been able to address that issue .	0		peanuts734	8
1036	So , what good is banning airlines from serving bags of peanuts if a passenger brings on a PBJ sandwich , or opens an energy bar that contains nuts ?	1	2103.0	peanuts734	9

1039	Many of the commenters indicate they want full bans on any peanut-containing products , including those brought on board by passengers .	0		peanuts720	4
1040	Which means this not puts the onus on the passenger to check the label of any food they bring on board , and eliminate any food that contains peanuts , is made with peanut oil , or was manufactured in a plant that also processes peanuts .	0		peanuts720	5
1041	Does this really reasonable to anyone ?	0		peanuts720	6
1042	Because banning airlines from distributing peanuts doesn't address the issue - only a full ban on any peanut product would suffice .	0		peanuts720	7
1043	Clearly , you can't ban passengers from bringing energy bars that may contain trace amounts of peanuts .	0		peanuts720	8
1044	Given that , why then even institute an airline ban , if it doesn't fully address the issue ?	0		peanuts720	9

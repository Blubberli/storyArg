1038	But the substance of the debate goes far beyond simple bags of peanuts .	0		peanuts720	3
1039	Many of the commenters indicate they want full bans on any peanut-containing products , including those brought on board by passengers .	0		peanuts720	4
1040	Which means this not puts the onus on the passenger to check the label of any food they bring on board , and eliminate any food that contains peanuts , is made with peanut oil , or was manufactured in a plant that also processes peanuts .	0		peanuts720	5
1041	Does this really reasonable to anyone ?	0		peanuts720	6
1042	Because banning airlines from distributing peanuts doesn't address the issue - only a full ban on any peanut product would suffice .	0		peanuts720	7
1043	Clearly , you can't ban passengers from bringing energy bars that may contain trace amounts of peanuts .	0		peanuts720	8

1230	"Speaking from one family's perspective , I'd estimate that the cost of this risk to the airlines is about $4,000 annually in our "" non-purchased "" airfares - we have the resources and inclination to travel , but refrain due to the risk ."	1	2179.0	peanuts911	4

1234	I support regulation restricting airlines from having peanuts or peanut-inclusive / based products on-board for all commercial flights regardless of the aircraft size , the flight segment being flown , etc .	0		peanuts911	8

1274	I originally had this posted in another section , but it seems more appropriate here .	1	2188.0	peanuts657	2
1275	I have an alternate solution to suggest : airline provided surgical masks to prevent airborne contamination and either thoroughly sanitized seating to prevent skin contact with oils left by previous passengers or , for those who don't feel secure in sanitization procedure , sealed cleanroom suits available upon request .	0		peanuts657	3
1276	A quick Google check turned up boxes of 50 medical grade surgical masks for $22 , a company named Microarray selling individually sealed cleanroom suits with hood and boots for $27.45 each , and a 40 pack of latex gloves for $6 .	0		peanuts657	4
1277	This provides a cheap and perfectly effective solution to what is , apparently , a very occasional problem .	0		peanuts657	5
1278	These masks and suits are considered safe enough to avoid contamination in the most sensitive of settings : operating rooms , high technology clean rooms , etc .	0		peanuts657	6

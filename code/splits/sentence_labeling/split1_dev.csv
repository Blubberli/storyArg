531	I am severely allergic to cats which leads to many of the same symptoms that people with peanut allergies have ( tightness in the chest , the feeling of their throat closing ) for me these symptoms are made more severe because I also have asthma , which kicks in when I am around cats - airway constriction , uncontrollable coughing etc .	1	1872.0	peanuts314	3
532	From reading some of the post I understand that the argument has been made that peanuts should be banned because people can die of a peanut allergy .	0		peanuts314	4

664	Also , if you can understand why it would bother religious people so much to remove those symbols , is it so hard to understand why some atheists would be bothered by their presence ?	0		cmv113	5
707	Personally , I think that Poles have made a big progress .	0		europolis18	2
708	That they tolerate other religions , races and I think , that people who come to our country often do not want to get to know us or accept our culture , religion – which I think are deeply rooted .	1	1940.0	europolis18	3

767	All this rule helps are the bad guys .	0		cmv42	10
768	The good guys aren't benefiting from this , because they ( usually ) wouldn't admit to something to begin with .	0		cmv42	11
769	"This rule is only in place for the sake of "" the system "" and I don't know how good that system is ."	0		cmv42	12

771	"I don't think there should be "" attorney privelege "" and that attorneys should be able to tell the court if their client admits to a charge ."	0		cmv42	2
772	CMV I'm posting in CMV because I don't have a lot of knowledge in this area at all , but I hold this controversial view .	0		cmv42	3
773	I am open to learning about why this privelege exists .	0		cmv42	4
774	While I understand that a defense attorney is there to defend you , I don't see how making it illegal for defense attorneys to say when their client admits to a charge is helping anyone .	0		cmv42	5
775	"People will explain this by saying , "" hopefully the courts figure out that he did it anyway , just have trust in the system "" ."	1	1966.0	cmv42	6
776	But the system isn't foolproof , and I don't know how defense attorneys can live with themselves knowing that they are defending someone who should be charged with the crime !	0		cmv42	7
777	I don't understand the system at all .	0		cmv42	8
778	Attorneys shouldn't be forced to keep these awful secrets , and we all want the bad guys to get their proper verdict , so why have this rule ?	0		cmv42	9
800	If the car helps you to secure a billion dollar deal , it was a good investment . edit : typo	0		cmv241	10
801	What you're saying is that there's basically no tangible difference between a $100,000 luxury car and a Rolls Royce / Bentley .	0		cmv241	2
802	I'm no expert , but my understanding is that the difference is that they're basically hand made .	0		cmv241	3
803	Leather is hand stitched , they have a wood working shop , it's all carefully hand crafted .	1	1975.0	cmv241	4
804	And as a result of all this , not many of these cars are made , which make the price higher .	1	1975.0	cmv241	5
805	The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4 - door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0 - 60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k .	1	1975.0	cmv241	6
806	I don't think it would be possible to easily produce and sell a car of similar quality for less .	0		cmv241	7
807	For people who have many millions ( or billions ) of dollars , the difference between a $100k and $250k for a luxury car isn't that big of a deal , and I think some rich people spend a lot of time in a car .	0		cmv241	8
808	Sometimes they just like to own a unique item , but also a status symbol can be worth a lot of money sometimes .	0		cmv241	9
809	So true !	0		peanuts519	2
810	I see this all the time .	1	1976.0	peanuts519	3
811	They try to ban peanuts at school because some over anxious mom saw something on TV about food allergies and that became her kids affliction du jour .	1	1976.0	peanuts519	4

824	I have been lethally allergic to peanuts all my life , and while I always carry multiple Epi-pens , I only forty minutes to get to a hospital after using them .	1	1986.0	peanuts295	2
825	I personally would like to see a ban on peanuts and enforcing passengers to refrain from bringing banned items on board .	0		peanuts295	3
826	But as another person pointed out , a lot of people are severely allergic to perfumes .	0		peanuts295	4
827	I think the DOT should ask allergists the most common causes of allergic anaphylaxis , and include those in the ban .	0		peanuts295	5
828	After all , no one NEEDS to wear perfumes or eat nuts .	0		peanuts295	6
829	Another option I support is having no food or snacks on domestic flights .	0		peanuts295	7
830	I think we should consider actual needs ( such as water ) on flights , instead of what people prefer .	0		peanuts295	8
837	Just a few quick comments : According to the TSA website ( you can bring EpiPens onboard an airplane .	0		peanuts849	2
838	I don't have an EpiPen , but I have Type I diabetes , and I bring an insulin pen and syringes with me on every flight ( about 12 times per year ) .	1	1991.0	peanuts849	3
839	"Also , while many peanut allergies are very serious , it is still not "" highly likely "" that a person with a peanut allergy with have a reaction on an airplane where peanuts are served ."	0		peanuts849	4
840	I can't access the entire article , but the following abstract has information on the number of peanut allergic individuals who had reactions inflight :	0		peanuts849	5
841	It should be part of the rule .	0		peanuts1105	2
842	As many times as I have flown , I can't remember a single time someone brought their own bag of peanuts on board .	1	1994.0	peanuts1105	3
843	But this way , if they are banned , you prevent some allergic person from potentially dying because someone is a selfish jerk .	1	1997.0	peanuts1105	4
844	I too have issues with the lack of healthy appealing food on flights .	1	1999.0	peanuts1111	2
845	I have many food allergies ( including peanuts ) and have trouble getting items through TSA security .	1	1998.0	peanuts1111	3
846	It's a real pain .	1	1998.0	peanuts1111	4
847	I'm flying in the morning and I'm trying to find things I can bring through that will allow me to eat healthfully on a cross country flight .	1	1998.0	peanuts1111	5
848	I wish they'd let me bring my portable protein drinks with me .	1	1999.0	peanuts1111	6
849	Unless you exclusively shop at vegetarian / vegan stores for food or grow your own food , you're giving money to a company that pays slaughterhouses to kill animals .	1	2003.0	cmv308	10
850	Why should I be a vegetarian then ?	0		cmv308	11
851	( Please please please convince me I'm wrong )	0		cmv308	12
852	While I agree with vegetarianism , I still eat meat because I don't think it will make a difference to the meat industry whether or not one person eats meat .	0		cmv308	2
853	CMV I think the way animals are treated here is absolutely detestable .	0		cmv308	3
854	I think as humans who have access to a vegetarian or vegan diet , we have a responsibility to not slaughter animals for meat .	0		cmv308	4
855	It's just that , I don't feel like whether or not I eat meat matters to companies that slaughter animals .	0		cmv308	5
856	My problem isn't with eating meat , it's with funding slaughterhouses .	0		cmv308	6
857	For instance , when I'm at a restaurant that serves meat with a vegetarian friend , they order a salad .	1	2002.0	cmv308	7
858	The money they spent still goes to a company that funds slaughterhouses , right ?	1	2002.0	cmv308	8
859	They don't separate vegan and carnivore money .	1	2002.0	cmv308	9
892	I agree that telling people they can't bring it on board is a bit much , but I definitely thing airlines themselves not offering it is a great step ( that limits the amount likely to be on board ) .	0		peanuts241	2
893	Also making an announcement that someone actually IS allergic on board and to please try to refrain from opening / eating any nut products during the flight would be nice .	0		peanuts241	3
894	I do think this could lessen the risk a great deal .	0		peanuts241	4
895	"My son's allergist told us not to bother with a "" peanut free "" table for him at lunch at school , it gives a false sense of security , but also not to let him sit RIGHT next to someone eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ."	1	2024.0	peanuts241	5
896	So for a lot of people , the airlines not serving it would probably do a lot for them .	0		peanuts241	6
897	I used to work at an aquatic center that had women's only hours once a week during which only female lifeguards would cover the pool .	1	2026.0	cmv294	2
898	As it was explained to me , the primary purpose of these hours was to give Muslim and Orthodox women a place to swim without violating their religion .	1	2026.0	cmv294	3
899	It was common for non-religious women to swim during these times because they felt more comfortable not having to swim in front of men .	1	2026.0	cmv294	4
900	I don't know what the rationale is at your gym .	0		cmv294	5
901	I would argue that yes , the women's only hours there may be sexist , but they also allow women to partake in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited to them during normal hours .	0		cmv294	6
902	This must be a very rare condition .	0		peanuts719	2
903	I've traveled extensively , both domestically and internationally , on airlines for fifty years and have never seen a person on an airplane have a peanut allergy attack .	1	2030.0	peanuts719	3
904	Also , this may be closing the barn door after the horse has run away .	0		peanuts719	4
905	When was the last time an airline gave anyone a bag of peanuts ?	0		peanuts719	5
906	Does that mean you should go around palling around with the friendly retards at the YMCA like your best buds ?	0		cmv40	10
907	Probably not : )	0		cmv40	11
908	The reason ” How did you get that answer wrong ?	0		cmv40	2
909	Are you retarded ? ”	0		cmv40	3
910	is unacceptable is because not every answer a person with intellectual disabilities ( the universally accepted description , for everyones information ) is wrong .	0		cmv40	4
911	Sometimes they give correct answers , and not just because of luck !	1	2033.0	cmv40	5
912	The people I work with try especially hard to learn and be correct when giving input .	1	2033.0	cmv40	6
913	I know this was just an example , and you probably have many others in mind , but there * is * a difference between a blind person not being able to see ( they can't ) , and a ” retard ” not being able to answer anything right ( they sometimes can't , just like you or I ) .	0		cmv40	7
914	For the record , the people I work with are apathetic to the ” r word ” , in every sense .	1	2034.0	cmv40	8
915	They are also aware that they have special needs , and would prefer if the public stop walking on eggshells trying to explain it in any other way .	1	2034.0	cmv40	9
1020	Our daughter is even allergic to airborne peanut dust in a plane when other people open their bag of complementary peanuts in the opposite end of the plane . . . gasping for air and almost choking .	1	2094.0	peanuts287	2
1021	Once she told the cabin crew about her allergy at the gate AND again when she got on the plane .	1	2095.0	peanuts287	3
1022	The result . . . they gave her a handi-towel and told her to wipe the armrests of her seat off .	1	2095.0	peanuts287	4
1023	Then , then served peanuts to everyone on the plane . . . even the people sitting next to her .	1	2095.0	peanuts287	5
1024	Should she have gotten any worse , they might have had to make an emergency landing . . . at whose expense ? ? ?	1	2098.0	peanuts287	6
1077	I know Delta serves peanuts as I travel to and from Detroit on Delta .	1	2111.0	peanuts1103	2
1078	I was really surprised to learn this as I didn't know until I was on the plane and in the air .	1	2111.0	peanuts1103	3
1079	I mean really , shouldn't they tell people before they pay for a flight ?	0		peanuts1103	4
1080	Oh and the two row minimum around a person with a peanut allergy is a joke .	0		peanuts1103	5
1081	Someone with a peanut allergy is not going to be protected by that !	0		peanuts1103	6
1137	Before we handed it in I had to hastily rewrite the whole thing because so much of what the others wrote wasn't even readable .	1	2141.0	cmv130	10
1138	Please .	0		cmv130	2
1139	Did it occur to you that you were taking introductory classes ?	0		cmv130	3
1140	Even if they weren't at the introductory level , some humanities classes are made for students in other programs to take as electives .	0		cmv130	4
1141	If you had aced something like critical perspectives or Middle English I'd be more impressed .	1	2143.0	cmv130	5
1142	Also , not all STEM students pick it up as well as you did .	1	2140.0	cmv130	6
1143	I've seen plenty of engineers get their asses handed to the by an English course .	1	2140.0	cmv130	7
1144	I took an elective commerce class where we had to do a group project .	1	2141.0	cmv130	8
1145	My group was mostly engineers and biology majors .	1	2141.0	cmv130	9
1246	One question : Before Poland joined the EU , the country already had some contact with neighbouring countries from the East .	0		europolis10	2
1247	So now , when Poland is a member of EU : Did this somehow influence the economic relations with neighbouring countries , which you had before ?	0		europolis10	3
1254	The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved * * significantly * * less stopping than the average driver makes .	1	2187.0	cmv46	10
1255	At steady speed highway driving , you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size / efficiency combustion engines because it is simple physics .	0		cmv46	11
1256	What you don't seem to be taking into account ( or at least understating the importance of ) is regenerative braking . 100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking .	0		cmv46	12
1257	Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [ as much as 50% ] ( of that energy .	0		cmv46	13
1258	For the sake of keeping things honest , let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient .	0		cmv46	14
1259	See the importance of regenerative braking ?	0		cmv46	15
1260	Using Newton's 2nd law , we can estimate that to get up to speed , Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy ( and fuel ) than Non-Hybrid X , but then when they both stop , Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses .	0		cmv46	16
1261	This is especially important because vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed ( Newton's 1st law ) .	0		cmv46	17
1262	Yes , weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road , but the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all .	0		cmv46	18
1263	So to summarize : Driving at a steady speed - slightly better fuel economy for non-Hybrids .	0		cmv46	19
1264	& gt ; 1 - In order to function , a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries , a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components ( eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking ) .	0		cmv46	2
1265	Driving with braking - significantly better fuel economy for Hybrids .	0		cmv46	20
1266	So like I said before , unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving ( and even then the highway better not be very busy ) , a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart .	0		cmv46	21
1267	[ According to the Prius wiki ] ( the battery pack weighs 118 lbs .	0		cmv46	3
1268	Since I can't find a figure online , let's say the electric motor components ( which are the major components for regenerative braking ) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing .	0		cmv46	4
1269	So 218 pounds out of a total of around [ 2900 lb curb weight ] ( puts ~ 7.5% more weight onto the vehicle .	0		cmv46	5
1270	Not as much as one might think .	0		cmv46	6
1271	( It's also the weight of a full grown adult , so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo .	0		cmv46	7
1272	Yes , that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy but it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking .	0		cmv46	8
1273	& gt ; It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius , and completely remove all of the electrical components , it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid .	1	2187.0	cmv46	9
1426	As a flight attendant of 19 + years , we never had peanut allergies in the earlier days , people dealt with their own issues and got on with it .	1	2248.0	peanuts142	2

1428	"It seems like the latest "" illness "" fad that plagues this country far too often ."	0		peanuts142	4
1429	BTW , no one has seemed to have died due to peanuts on Southwest , why does this have to be a Federal issue ?	0		peanuts142	5
1480	I agree with you .	0		europolis6	2
1481	Even in such a small town like Malbork , which counts 40 thousand inhabitants , I have observed that there are many changes , for example restoration of streets , sidewalks and building an entertainment arena , so I can see an improvement as well .	1	2269.0	europolis6	3

4043	So , I think this is a pretty common viewpoint among smokers - pre-made cigarettes have a bunch of additives and stuff ( eg . it seems modern cigarettes have paper which is supposed to stop burning if you don't puff , obviously you need more chemicals to do this and you just end up inhaling them ) , while when rolling your own you are putting in just tobacco , so it has to be healthier .	0		cmv50865	3

4045	"Roll your own also has other benefits - they tend to be more cost-effective ( but lets disregard this ) , and the common wisdom is that you will smoke less of them since you have to roll them and this takes time , so you end up smoking less in total , thus making them "" healthier "" ."	0		cmv50865	5
4046	Then again , I guess you can just add in a ton of tobacco and offset these effects .	0		cmv50865	6

I get a flu shot every year, my kids and pets are vaccinated, and I’ve gotten all my vaccine boosters as an adult without hesitation. Yet I still might wait to get this one. Not because it was rushed, but because I’ve lost faith in the system. How can I trust the information put out by the CDC at this point, when the Trump administration was allowed to control their message throughout the pandemic? It feels so me that politics was allowed to take precedence over science, and that the messages of the CDC were swayed by Trump’s whims...especially in terms of schools reopening. How do I feel safe that the vaccine process wasn’t tainted in some way by Trump and his flunkies?

Imagine a world where:

Immigrants or otherwise undocumented people are basically unable to participate in even basic things like go to the store  usong apple pay because they are unable to obtain a valid digital id. 

The tourism industry suffers as travellees without this digital id cannot participate in events requiring it. 

Your poorer friends unable to afford a 1000$ phone are simply not able to go with you to hotels, concerts, sports, or while travelling.  You simply stop hanging out with these people so you can live your life. 

Men and women use the app to enter toilets changing rooms etc, requiring transsexuals to prove they had a sex change using this app to enter a toilet, and non binary people having their birth sex outed constantly.  Gay people will be on record as gay and things lime blood donor discrimination will continje easily except now you cant even lie your way around it. 

People with heart conditions or other medical issues will no longer be able to assume risks of thinvs like riding a roller coaster or the like.  The establjshments that deem them too high risk will simply exclude them from their service.  To avoid this happening to patients people will avoid going to doctors for fear of being diagnosed, as their medical records are basically not private as a result of this

There will be further social ostrasizing of peoe who dont get vaccinated for legitimage health reasons or people who are simply scared.  This will further push them to dig in their heels and give more indignancy to the anti vax movement because theyll feel they are being forced and be more cautios about it.

1. For 5 years, every time my wife went to the gyno, they tried to push a new drug on her. Since there were no long-term clinical trials, she said no. The OB-GYN gave her a hard time, but she held her ground. Sure enough, after 5 years, it was discovered people who had taken the drug were dealing with illnesses and severe side effects. Class action lawsuits started. My wife and I vowed after that we would NEVER take a drug/vaccine that hasn't had long-term clinical trials (5 years or more).
2. COVID is a very close relative of rhinovirus, the same type of virus that causes the common cold. We've never produced a vaccine for the common cold (and why should we? it constantly mutates so a vaccine would be useless within a year). Does anyone else find it slightly suspicious that we've never been able to find a cure for the common cold (or any autoimmune disorder) despite decades of work, and then we suddenly and conveniently produce a vaccine for coronavirus in just 8 months?
3. When I turned 18, my parents said 'you're old enough to decide for yourself now if you want to get a flu shot each year.' 16 years have passed since then. Only once in that stretch have I gotten the flu, and guess what? It was coincidentally the only year in that stretch where I took the flu shot. Made me wonder...
4. I'm 34 years old, I'm in OUTSTANDING physical shape (probably top 5% of my age bracket in terms of physical fitness and overall health), and I have no pre-existing conditions. For people like me, COVID has a 99.998% survival rate. That rate doesn't justify taking a potentially risky vaccine that hasn't had long-term clinical trials, no matter what the ""experts"" claim. They don't know for sure. It's that simple. They don't know for sure what the long-term effects will be. So I'll take the 99.998% chance over sticking some needle in my arm that could wind up REALLY fucking me up down the road.

No way am I taking a ""vaccine"" that has been in production for only 8 months. I ain't taking it until at least 2025. Good luck to the rest of you who do."

Why, of course it does. Different genetic makeup, hence you expect a difference efficacy. Different exposure, e.g. nurses being exposed to very high viral loads, of course you expect different result, different age groups, different placebos, no placebos at all in some cases. Even more worrying, that some subgroups seem to have been discarded entirely. Now sure, you could average over all of that. But that's just not how phase 3 trials are supposed to be conducted, and for good reasons.

> There isn't huge variation in doses. Just an error with 1 group which can likely be taken out

That's unfortunately not true. From the Wired article:

>> The doses are measured by the number of altered viral particles they contain, and the developers decided that the standard dose would be 5 x 10^10 viral particles. But for many of those arms in the UK trial—as well as everyone who got the vaccine in the Brazilian trial—**publicly available trial information shows that the standard dose could be between 3.5 and 6.5 × 10^10 viral particles**. The lower end of that range isn’t far off from a half-dose.

> Do you really think the best scientists in the world

I'm one myself, so yeah I think it's definitely possible that they made mistakes. You have to see this in the proper context, this was the first vaccine globally (except perhaps Chinese versions) that went into a phase 3 trial, and the whole thing was developed and approved for test phases much, much faster than would normally be the case. It's easily possible that corners were cut where necessary, and that the regulator approved incomplete or shaky test protocols out of a necessity to develop this fast. Also, the fact that phase 3 was started just before (or already during) the March UK lockdown presented a problem that you don't normally encounter, that the exposure of your control groups was too little to allow for proper statistics. That's why they restarted in Brazil, and it was always going to be difficult to use those results as one combined study.

> If they don't then they will continue the trials until they do

Absolutely. That's why they started an entirely fresh phase-3 trial in the US. But that wasn't started until late August and then held up by that case of a severe side effect in one of the UK groups. so it's well behind Pfizer and Moderna at this stage. I never said the vaccine is useless, only that the data so far won't see it approved.

> is horseshit as you haven't even seen the data.

Everything we know about the data, and how the test was conducted, points in that direction. The Wired article contains information about the trials that is in the public domain, beyond what's in the press release. Even just the mere fact that they *have* to combine two tests in two different countries, conducted under different conditions, will likely prevent this from being approved anywhere. And AstraZeneca makes no secret that this was always the plan.

> So much lack of education in everything you wrote tbh.

Oh dear. I presented arguments. Where are yours? Your only argument seems to be ""you don't know, they will know better than you"". But yeah — from what AstraZeneca themselves say, it's black on white that their data so far is a right shambles."	"From the Wired article:

We have to readjust our risk tolerance for long COVID compared to death. At the beginning of this we weighed the public health risk of the restrictions necessary to keep COVID at bay with COVID's primary negative outcome: death. We knew that shutting down businesses and locking down society would harm people. We just calculated that it would harm fewer people than COVID.

If suddenly the risk of death is gone, your risk of catching it is lower, and the primary risk is long COVID in a minority of patients, you have to recalculate if continued restrictions are worth it (and which restrictions are worth it).

Asking for restrictions that will stem the spread of a deadly disease is not selfish. Asking for restrictions that will stem the spread of a more mild disease might be. When you ask a school child to give up his/her education or a business owner to fail, it needs to be in exchange for something undeniably worthwhile. If tens of millions of parents are having a hard time feeding their kids, and tens of millions of kids are missing out on a quality education because people don't want to take on a small risk of damaged sense of smell or greater susceptibility to heart disease later in life, then that's selfish.

It has been approved in the *UK*, but neither the European Union nor any other European country has approved it.  Also, India likely approved it because the UK did.

Second, the US isn't ""waiting until April,"" but some people have stated that's when it might be approved.  The simple fact is that it's not even possible to approve at this point because Astrazeneca hasn't even applied for approval in the U.S. (or EU for that matter).  

They probably haven't applied because they know there's a good chance they'll get rejected without U.S. data, especially when the data from other countries suffers from so many problems (many mistakes, low sample size, etc.).  These problems will  *hopefully* be resolved when the next month or two with the conclusion of Astrazeneca's trials in the U.S.  Because of mistakes, the sample size for any particular regimen of administering the vaccine is anywhere from 1/15 to 1/5 the size of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, depending upon which regimen you look at.  (Pfizer and Moderna tested just one regimen, whereas Astrazeneca ""tested"" about 5 across 12k people in the trials that have been released, because of differences in trials in the UK and Brazil, in addition to the many mistakes that were made during the trials (including incorrect dosages and incorrect timing of vaccine administration).)

The truth is, the UK is really going past the science in their approval.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but that's a fact.  They have advised that doses for both Astrazeneca and Pfizer should be given 12 weeks apart, and that individuals who receive one particular vaccine first can receive the other vaccine second.  Necessary?  Will it save lives? Probably.  But not grounded in trials that actually tested this, particularly for Pfizer.  And this recommendation has been done against Pfizer's own admonishment that there is no data to support this regimen actually working for their vaccine.  The UK is engaging in what one might call ""armchair"" science.  Normally, we have a hypothesis and test it.  They have a hypothesis, and are determining conditions are so dire that they must act on it without testing it first, because based on our experience with other vaccines, this will *probably* be good.

There's also the fact that the U.S. simply doesn't need more vaccine at this moment.  Right now, the hold up isn't the number of vaccines, it's administration of vaccines.

Hope this is helpful!"

Teachers in Oklahoma know this truth all too well, tbh. So a ""starting salary"" of say, $34k in Oklahoma (according to our state payroll data, anyway) ... is quite a bit less in ""real"" salary.

And most teachers work an average of 45-55 hours a week and are exempt from paid overtime.

Our industry is already short staffed in many chains and in many areas throughout the country. Depending on where we work we may have to fill hundreds of prescriptions, while giving COVID shots and other immunizations to people. 

Giving shots is no small task. We have to screen for safety and appropriateness. We have to run the paperwork through the computer system. Getting vaccines ready can take time, time away from us being able to do our actual job. I'd say each shot takes at least 10-15 minutes unless you have a clinic set up.

We don't have enough time in the day to give 40 shots and fill every prescription.

Most of us don't get to take breaks or even have a lunch, working 8-12 hr shifts. The COVID shots will have to be billed by the end of the day so we will likely be doing a lot of overtime, potentially not for pay.

I asked if it would be okay to go to work.
They said sure, just go to the hospital if anything changes.
I worked as a server at this point.


Well I accidentally pinched my arm with a tray.
It immediately turn in a blood blister and bruised.
I got lucky that a coworker was two weeks away from graduating with her RN.
She told me to go to the hospital.
ER had tested me and found 5000 platelets at the time.
So they admit me into the hospital.


THE VERY NEXT MORNING I get a call from the clinic panicking.


Clinic: ""You need to go to the hospital right now!
You only have 4000 platelets.
Just tell us which ER you are going to and we will call ahead.""


Me: ""I am already in the hospital.
I pinched my arm and developed a huge blood blister and bruise."""	23	193	True

I also took virology but in 2006. I don’t even remember what I learned about coronaviruses though I do remember living through SARS and the panic it caused, which you said was before you were born. How much do you remember from ~~classes you took 12 years ago?~~(edit: I have a math learning disability lol) the early ‘00s? How much does anyone remember?

I took virology again in 2009 in veterinary school, which was several orders of magnitude more difficult but again - there wasn’t much focus on coronavirus. I remember learning what it did in dogs and that we have a vaccine for them, but that’s about it. I also learned about rinderpest and smallpox and how they were eradicated because veterinarians are considered frontline defenders for zoonotic diseases. In my 8 years so far of practice, I’ve seen only one case of coronavirus that some other doctor confirmed with an expensive special send out test. It ended up being irrelevant to the patient. I’ve had to do a huge degree of brushing up on my virology this year, and my past education merely gave me a deeper and broader baseline understanding. 

Coronaviruses are NOT “relatively unable” to mutate - did you even read the article? Did you read the part about the three letter deletions? Do you have the knowledge base to understand why diseases get worse with every species they jump through because of what it does to mutations? That’s why bird flu and swine flu were so bad. You may not see rapid, dramatic mutations in a single person or region, however, it’s like pulling the handle on a genetic slot machine any time a virus jumps to an animal due to differences in their genetic code. The virus has spread across the entire globe faster than any disease ever has in all of human history. Different countries are spontaneously getting different mutations, and some spread more quickly than others. Different mink farms are also seeing different genetic variants - cluster 5 was just one of several already found. They’re little mutation machines, just like bats.

The scary stuff happens when a virus hops back from animals to people, hence why the mink situation needs to be monitored extremely closely - as the article also explains. Yes, SARS1 and the scary mutation to the spike protein in mink disappeared as spontaneously as they came, but it’s naive and foolish to think that correlates with safety. 

Now think about what happens if a farmer gives SARS-2 to his minks, the minks pass it among themselves like wildfire because of the abhorrent way they are housed, they give it to a barn cat who gives it back to more minks (maybe at the farm down the road), and the minks give it back to a person - now what sort of mutations has it accumulated? Every species jump mixes up genetic data. Denmark has already seen a single farm have two separate SARS2 outbreaks and the second was genetically different from the first. The farmer was hopeful that his surviving flock could breed covid resistant animals but the second outbreak was just as devastating as the first. Now they are all dead from the cull. They’ve also found that 4/5 wild minks in Denmark were born on mink farms (farm minks eat ocean fish, wild eat freshwater fish, and the difference can be molecularly identified in their teeth and claws) so it’s safe to assume more than a handful of mink from impacted farms have escaped. It’s unlikely a positive mink would - at least 30% are dead (sometimes way more) within 1-3 days of symptoms first being observed. Several mink also escaped during the cull (there’s video of this) and there’s also pictures and video of overflowing trucks spilling dead, rotting mink along KILOMETERS of road (we learned in March/April that dead bodies are infectious when morgue attendants, pathologists, and body handlers started dying). I’ve seen video of farmers who put most of their dead minks in huge dumpsters or shipping containers they could close but they didn’t all fit so they just left the extra ones in nasty piles out in the open while they wait for the gov’t to send out trucks to pick them up. He said he couldn’t stop the foxes from coming to get them. Dead minks are bubbling up out of mass graves wreaking similar environmental havoc. There are 3x as many minks in Denmark than there are humans. 

Let’s not forget that states with the largest mink populations, like Utah and Wisconsin, are also experiencing catastrophic human outbreaks. Correlation doesn’t imply causation, but I definitely worry about US mink farmers going bar hopping on the weekend. God help us if they are anti-maskers. The mink versions aren’t worse, per se, but they definitely speed up the mutation process in a region. I haven’t seen much data/research from the US about our own minks, which worries me. 

See how I shared all that without being an asshole or attacking you? If you want sources I shared more than enough info for you to be able to google them on your own.

1. For 5 years, every time my wife went to the gyno, they tried to push a new drug on her. Since there were no long-term clinical trials, she said no. The OB-GYN gave her a hard time, but she held her ground. Sure enough, after 5 years, it was discovered people who had taken the drug were dealing with illnesses and severe side effects. Class action lawsuits started. My wife and I vowed after that we would NEVER take a drug/vaccine that hasn't had long-term clinical trials (5 years or more).
2. COVID is a very close relative of rhinovirus, the same type of virus that causes the common cold. We've never produced a vaccine for the common cold (and why should we? it constantly mutates so a vaccine would be useless within a year). Does anyone else find it slightly suspicious that we've never been able to find a cure for the common cold (or any autoimmune disorder) despite decades of work, and then we suddenly and conveniently produce a vaccine for coronavirus in just 8 months?
3. When I turned 18, my parents said 'you're old enough to decide for yourself now if you want to get a flu shot each year.' 16 years have passed since then. Only once in that stretch have I gotten the flu, and guess what? It was coincidentally the only year in that stretch where I took the flu shot. Made me wonder...
4. I'm 34 years old, I'm in OUTSTANDING physical shape (probably top 5% of my age bracket in terms of physical fitness and overall health), and I have no pre-existing conditions. For people like me, COVID has a 99.998% survival rate. That rate doesn't justify taking a potentially risky vaccine that hasn't had long-term clinical trials, no matter what the ""experts"" claim. They don't know for sure. It's that simple. They don't know for sure what the long-term effects will be. So I'll take the 99.998% chance over sticking some needle in my arm that could wind up REALLY fucking me up down the road.

No way am I taking a ""vaccine"" that has been in production for only 8 months. I ain't taking it until at least 2025. Good luck to the rest of you who do."

Your body's immune system will see these strange proteins and start freaking out about it, producing fever, soreness, localized inflammation, ect. The important part, is it will also produce cells that glom onto the virus, immobilizing it. These cells will hang around for a bit, and your body will remember how to make them for even longer. 

Some vaccines include stuff that makes your immune system ""suspicious"", called adjuvants. I do not know if cv19 vaccines do. This makes your immune system more reactive in general, meaning that leas ""stuff"" is needed in the vaccine to get a proper response. The side effects of this would be your immune system reacting more strongly to other things, so you might have worse allergies for a few days if the vaccine contains those.

Our industry is already short staffed in many chains and in many areas throughout the country. Depending on where we work we may have to fill hundreds of prescriptions, while giving COVID shots and other immunizations to people. 

Giving shots is no small task. We have to screen for safety and appropriateness. We have to run the paperwork through the computer system. Getting vaccines ready can take time, time away from us being able to do our actual job. I'd say each shot takes at least 10-15 minutes unless you have a clinic set up.

It will definitely be crucial to communicate honestly in order to gain more widespread acceptance. 

The ""deal with it"" attitude comes from frustration with general vaccine skepticism. Common childhood vaccines are very safe and significant side-effects very rare and the overall benefit to society is so very clear. No matter how much research and communication we put out there is still a significant number of people who push back with disinformation. The issue being they work so well that the diseases they prevent are so uncommon now I can see the concern on an individual level if there is an apparent significant risk at all, most people do not possess the skills to property evaluate the information for themselves. 

As these articles rightly discuss (this is the third I've seen this week before the study has even been published) it will likely be a different conversation as the disease is so common but immune reactions much more pronounced. Concern and skepticism in this case is very reasonable but the reasons for the general public's nervousness is mostly down to anti-vax false and misleading information that has been pushed for years. 

I would speculate you are right that it is a downside of a quick development cycle in that they have titrated the dose for maximum efficacy with the trade-off being a more noticeable immune reaction. In the Pfizer vaccine it seems no significant medical intervention was required for any of the 20,000 in the vaccine arm. I will need to read up on the Moderna results as at this time my government has a confirmed order with Pfizer but not Moderna and I will likely be one of the initial priority group."

I agree wholeheartedly that the overall mortality rate is low.  Very, very, very low for relatively young and healthy people. What mortality does not tell you is anything about hospitalizations. That is the number that should frighten us. We simply do not have the capacity to handle all of the health crises that require critical care AND the pandemic. Just because we’re talking small percentages with regard to covid, it does not convey urgency unless those small numbers are viewed in relation to the number of staffed critical care beds. 

All told, what this means is that a hospital that gets swamped with critical care COVID patients cannot handle - in the same manner as prior to the pandemic - every other instance of people needing critical care. Quality of care is declining all over the nation. We can have a mortality rate that is a tiny fraction of a percent and still be in this predicament. 

I have family members who are at risk due to preexisting conditions, but COVID is, honestly, the least of my concerns. If my mom has a major stroke tomorrow, the quality of care she will receive will not be the same as a year ago. In cases of stroke, small lapses in care can have a huge impact on recovery. If, god forbid, my family were in a bad car accident, the same issues would arise. If I were to need ICU care, I’d want a nurse and physician with a normal work load. Right now, none of those exist.

This sort of demotion is actually the *typical* pathway for academia. *Most* people in her position get demoted and told they can either stay on as a non-tenure faculty (typically working under someone with tenure), or leave. Almost everyone leaves, because the pay is abysmal compared to industry. The whole model of academia is just sort of shitty if you expect to get a professorship.

Long term just means they last for ages.   If the vaccine made your arm fall off immediately after injection it would be a long term side effect because you’re not growing a new arm.

However, we’d have noticed a trend of arms falling off.   All reasonable/logical possible side effects would occur pretty quickly.   The mRNA will be broken down within days.   The proteins within weeks.   They won’t be anything around to suddenly cause a problem in 5 years or 30 years.   

Reasonable fears are things like:

a) allergic reactions (because there’s always someone allergic to something).   Those are very rapid onset.   General advice for any vaccine you haven’t taken before is to hang around the clinic for 15 minutes.   Especially if you have a history of allergies.  It’s just standard safety.

b) auto-immune reactions - where your body makes an antibody to attack the COVID protein, but it happens to attack your own cells as well.   Those should present within 6 weeks.   Otherwise you’ve got to explain how your body had those antibodies floating around but they didn’t actually do anything for a few years.  (And that’s just not how they work.).  If they were common, we’d have seen them by now in the trials.   (Note - auto-immune reactions are actually comparatively common from viral infections.   There have been a few documented from various vaccines - but fewer than caused by the the corresponding natural disease.  It’s likely some cases of long covid are auto-immune reactions.)

c) extremely rare auto-immune reactions that actually do happen within 6 weeks but are just so rare that we can’t statistically link them to the vaccine until 1 million people have been vaccinated.    The key point there is they’d be extremely rare - it’s the only way to miss them during phase 2/3 testing.

Stop and think about things that do cause late presenting side effects.   Things like:

a) heavy metals or asbestos that the body can’t get rid of and slowly cause damage.   Doesn’t apply here because mRNA and the protein it creates are short lived.

b) toxins/radiation that causes cancer by damaging your DNA.  Doesn’t apply here.   The mRNA from the vaccine doesn’t get near your DNA.

c) stuff like alcohol or various meds that eventually cause noticeable damage after you’ve consumed them for years.  Again, doesn’t apply because vaccination isn’t something you’re doing every day for years.

There’s just no logical mechanism for a vaccine to cause a side effect that suddenly appears years later."

Once in a while there was a smoke that really hit the spot but 99% of them were forgettable, or even regrettable as I’d suddenly become acutely aware of how much they stink. A good salt nic vape was what finally gave me an alternative to smoking that replicated all the habits and wasn’t painful and nigh impossible for me like cold turkey was.

Longest quit was when I was dating a woman who didn’t like smoking, but even that willpower broke eventually because I still had the mentality that I was giving up something I liked.

I’m so glad my current doctor is a former smoker as well. She gets it.

And the administration didn’t want to show favoritism.

The three vaccine technologies sponsored by the administration through Operation Warp Speed were each developed by a pair of pharmaceutical companies. Pfizer-BioNTech were the only pair to not accept the administration’s money, because Pfizer thought government oversight would hinder development and they also did not want any of the political associations/leverages associated with accepting government money. The other two pairs accepted the administration’s money, and the administration allocated those funds accordingly.

The three vaccine technologies sponsored by the administration through Operation Warp Speed were each developed by a pair of pharmaceutical companies.
Pfizer-BioNTech were the only pair to not accept the administration’s money, because Pfizer thought government oversight would hinder development and they also did not want any of the political associations/leverages associated with accepting government money.
The other two pairs accepted the administration’s money, and the administration allocated those funds accordingly.

Not based on covid cases. 

Also I say this as my entire family lives in one of the hardest hit areas in Alberta. Giving vaccines to Alberta over other provinces sets a dangerous precedent. It would effectively reward a government for prioritizing economy and political power over lives. 

The Alberta government willfully ignored the second wave, in fact early September the day after BC enacted measures and closed high risk business in preparation for respiratory season, the Alberta government mocked the measures as ""[micromanaging the pandemic](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-kenney-covid-restrictions-businesses-1.5717961)"" and refused to enact similar measures.

At that time BC and Alberta were at the same spot. BC reported 110 new cases a day while Alberta was reporting 150. Today BC seen growth and is reporting 700 new cases a day while Alberta is about to hit 2000. Even then BC enacted even stronger measures long before Alberta responded. 

The Alberta government used false equivalencies and red herrings to justify doing nothing. 

My favourite was the Premier claim that restrictions violate Charter Rights. Never mind that section 1 of the Charter states that response limits are allowed as long as the limitations are reasonably justified and consistent with the needs of a free and democratic society. And also that the Premier went out of his way to fight against the rights of [gay couples to marry](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mp-doubts-social-benefit-of-same-sex-marriage/article975956/) and has several times suggested using the [Not with standing clause](https://pressprogress.ca/jason-kenney-said-he-wanted-to-override-the-constitution-to-block-gay-rights-in-alberta/) (s. 33 of the Charter) to exempt legislation from the Charter rights.  

Then when it became clear to them that hosptials were overwhelmed they still resisted new measures and instead wanted the Federal Government and Red Cross to build [4x field hosptials to deal with the surge.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-planning-covid-19-field-hospitals-for-750-patients-internal-document-shows-1.5826336) I am pretty sure that's when the federal government pressures them for stronger measures. 

The issues were never even ideological. Other [Conservative governments](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-jason-kenney-alberta-covid-politics-1.5818058) have acted with stronger measures. The main reason they were [worried about loosing power](https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/corbella-8) because a small group of people opposed to restrictions might split off and form another party."

And that's even for countries with advanced medicine tech. Throw in the second booster shot plus priority lists, and that's how we have the mess we have.

I think most people do not understand that it isn't actually very difficult to keep the vaccines cold.  The solution they are using is *quite literally* a styrofoam box with some dried ice in it.  Then they use a thermocouple or some other form of thermometry to monitor and record the temperature.  This is also simple.  I could rig up such a device (not medical grade quality/reliability, of course) in 20 minutes.  Pfizer had months to do so and they have built extremely high quality boxes to do this, and (frankly) I doubt it was at all difficult for them to do so.

In the U.S. none of this should not be an issue. The only reason that it is (sort of) right now, is that states are being too strict with their prioritization.  The short shelf life after thawing shouldn't be an issue in urban areas (where over half the population lives), because people should be (literally or figuratively) lining up for shots.

I can't find the link, but the other day there was a hospital that had 800 doses that were going to expire in 2 hours.  They managed to give them all out.

Of course, we do need other vaccines for rural areas, but mRNA should be a totally viable solution in a country like the U.S."	The solution they are using is *quite literally* a styrofoam box with some dried ice in it.	0	1	[0.09520493 0.9047951 ]	1	[0.02185559 0.9781444 ]	1	[0.11404835 0.8859517 ]	1	48543	1	N	O	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	"I can't find the link, but the other day there was a hospital that had 800 doses that were going to expire in 2 hours.

30,000 people were given injections, told that it might be a vaccine or it might be a placebo, and they are to go home and behave exactly as if they were not vaccinated at all, keep masking and distancing and what not. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers know who got the vaccine vs the placebo, but the data is recorded and accessible to an independent third party. The volunteer receive regular phone calls to monitor their symptoms, and if they become symptomatic for Covid they get swabbed. The number of infections are recorded. 

Over time, 196 people were found to be infected. Most people are not infected. This number was high enough to meet pre-established requirements.  At that point, an independent independent third party were allowed to reveal that the majority of the infections happened in the placebo group.  If the vaccine doesn't work at all, when you find 196 infections, you would expect about 90 in the vaccine group and 90 in the placebo group. The probability of a 185 vs 11 breakdown is less than 0.1% if the vaccine doesn't work. So this is very strong evidence that the vaccine is working."	30,000 people were given injections, told that it might be a vaccine or it might be a placebo, and they are to go home and behave exactly as if they were not vaccinated at all, keep masking and distancing and what not.	0	1	[0.00606949 0.9939306 ]	1	[0.0255636 0.9744364]	1	[8.5984869e-04 9.9914014e-01]	1	20325	0							"This number was high enough to meet pre-established requirements.

You know when you go shopping and see a store say ""save upto 90%"" but really it has one shirt size xxxxl on  sale 90% but everything else in the store is 20% off?  Its like that. 

On average they are putting it at 70%  the low end is 62%  those are the numbers for the vast majority of those enrolled in the study. Regular dose followed by regular dose.  

However a very small group (like 2500) got half dose followed by a higher dose. 

There was a lot of concern and confusion about the dosing and why it worked better. The AZ ceo said, oh that was an accident. Called it ""serendipity "".  He said that group got half the dose and no one realized it until they found that group had lower adverse events and side effects. Oops. But they decided to give the higher dose and they saw upto 90% efficacy. What luck!  Oxford head said well actually the manufacturer ""(not AZ)"" gave the researchers a lessened amount of drug and they realized it pretty quick. They asked committee  what should they do and the committee said go forward and give a higher dose. They expected the low dose higher dose to be equally effective as normal dose x2. That would have good luck for them. 

As a general rule of thumb, you say we are going to test this by a very strict set of guidelines and rules. The fact that it didnt happen is bad. The fact that their normal dosing didnt work as expected doesnt help. 

Astrazenaca has said two things, hey everyone we're cheaper and hey lower doses means more doses for everyone. That is also a big spin and doesnt help build confidence.  If it wasnt homegrown at oxford then I think the uk regulators would be shutting it down or asking even harder questions."	"""Up to""

 Basically the spike protein changes its structure when it comes in contact with the ACE2 receptor in the cell (post-fusion form, looking a bit like a needle), that helps the virus enter the cell.

What was found is that in SARS-COV2 the spike protein can also spontaneously turn into the postfusion form when engulfed by dendritic cells, this is bad, because antibodies tuned for the post-fusion form of the spike are neither protective nor neutralizing, and T-Cell responses are significantly less effective.

This 'hack'  is present in both of the mRNA vaccines as well as the J&J AD26 vaccine.

The mutations you are talking about are different, those have naturally appeared as result of the virus evolution. The variants are significant because some of them have mutations on the receptor binding domain within the spike protein (the part that locks into the ACE2 receptor in the cell) and besides being more transmissible, in the particular case of the south african variant the mutations are so significant that there is data suggesting that antibodies for the current dominant version of the virus will not be as effective against it. Now, T cell response is very likely unaffected by this, but the reduction in antibody efficacy will be a bummer in terms of the efficacy of the vaccine as a whole."	euh, no, not exactly...

Past unsuccessful attempts to neutralize RSV with a vaccine had focused on the virus’s class 1 fusion protein, or F protein.

It can look one way before the RSV virus infects and enters a cell, and another way after the virus multiplies and escapes. These Jekyll-and-Hyde identities are known as the “prefusion” and “postfusion” states, and all vaccine attempts up until this point had focused on the latter.
To make matters trickier, the prefusion form is extremely unstable: It can irreversibly and spontaneously snap to its other state in an instant. Graham and McLellan hypothesized that they might create a more successful RSV vaccine if they could lock in the prefusion state. But no one knew what the prefusion protein looked like; they just knew it was a trickster.
So, McLellan used x-ray crystallography—a technique that uses x-ray beams to determine the structure of proteins—to capture an image of the prefusion protein for the first time. Some researchers would later say the prefusion F protein looked like a lollipop. McLellan thought it looked like a Nerf football. “You’re one of the first people in the world to see what this protein looks like,” he says. “It’s pretty cool.”
The work of Jason and Barney and others revolutionized the field.

By examining the protein at this atomic level, McLellan found a way to bioengineer it to take away its shape-shifting power. In other words, he stabilized it.
When Graham tested this new molecule in animals, it acted as an antigen and stimulated the immune system to fight disease. It had 50 times more neutralizing power against RSV than anything he had tested before. On the flip side, they also showed a postfusion version of the protein takes on an identity that can bypass the immune system’s defenses.
Their accomplishment won runner-up recognition in Science’s 2013 Breakthrough of the Year, and their work carved the way for new RSV vaccines that are showing great promise, Graham says.
“The work of Jason and Barney and others revolutionized the field,” says Ruth Karron, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the director of the Center for Immunization Research and the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative.
The lucky last step
Five years ago, a postdoctoral fellow in Graham's laboratory returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia with a respiratory infection. Everyone assumed the fellow had Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by a dangerous coronavirus that had arisen in the country two years earlier.
That emergence happened around the same time that McLellan launched his own lab at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. McLellan and Graham had been trying the prefusion trick on MERS, given that coronaviruses feature spike proteins that are also shapeshifters and are used to break into our cells. When Graham's lab tested the postdoc's nasal secretions, they found a related germ—and an opportunity that would pave their final steps toward a COVID-19 vaccine.
The postdoc had an older coronavirus: HKU1, a mild cold-causing bug that was discovered in 2005. The Graham-McLellan partnership decided to pivot their focus to HKU1 because MERS required extra safety precautions, and their research on the latter had hit a wall.
To capture a 3D picture of HKU1, McLellan would need a different method for taking atomic-level pictures. X-ray crystallography saturates proteins in a salt bath solution until they form crystals akin to rock candy. But due to their physical nature, coronaviruses don’t crystalize well. Cryogenic electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, is a technique that allows scientists to view proteins frozen in a thin layer of ice, bypassing the need for crystallization.

In 2015, structural biologist Andrew Ward was one of the leading cryo-EM experts in the U.S., so McLellan emailed his lab at Scripps Research in San Diego to ask if he had any interest in studying coronaviruses. Coincidentally, Ward had a postdoctoral fellow with a hankering to examine coronaviruses. They ultimately took thousands of images of HKU1 proteins.
McLellan used this 3D readout of HKU1 to make educated guesses at how to stabilize the spike proteins from its viral cousins, MERS and SARS. McLellan and Nianshuang Wang, his postdoctoral fellow, discovered that by adding two prolines—rigid amino acids—to MERS’s spike protein, they could prevent it from changing shape.
They called the tweak a 2P mutation and filed a patent for it in 2017. Around the same time, Graham’s lab partnered with biotech company Moderna to design an experimental mRNA vaccine for MERS. The two had worked together a year prior on a similar but separate project to combat the Zika virus—as part of a new movement for more comprehensive preparations against global outbreaks. The concept hinged on the detailed study of a prototypical member of a viral family—such as HKU1 or MERS—to build defenses against all future troublemakers from the same family like SARS-CoV-2.
Ultimately, experiments in animal models showed the MERS vaccine was successful, says Kizzmekia Corbett, a postdoctoral research fellow in Graham’s laboratory, and created a “portfolio of data” that the scientists knew they could apply to the new coronavirus.
The road to salvation
On January 6, 2020, just minutes after he took that phone call at the ski shop, McLellan messaged Wang and Daniel Wrapp, a graduate student, on WhatsApp.
“Barney is going to try and get the coronavirus sequence out of Wuhan, China,” McLellan wrote to them. “He wants to rush a structure and vaccine. You game?”
The two labs worked in concert with one another, determining the virus’s structure in about two weeks and using the 2P mutation to stabilize its proteins. Graham’s lab partnered with Moderna, and Corbett designed and executed clinical assessments to immunize mice with an mRNA vaccine made with the modified proteins starting in February. “When we got the first results from the mice, and they had a great antibody response, it was so gratifying,” Corbett says. By March 4, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had greenlit the Moderna vaccine for human trials.
At about the same time, Pfizer and BioNTech spoke with Graham about using the 2P mutation in their vaccine. Because their work was patented and widely published, other drugmakers—including Novavax and Johnson & Johnson—also based their candidates on the design. Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine would become the first authorized in the U.S. after it showed an impressive 95-percent efficacy rate. Moderna’s vaccine was 94-percent effective.
(Related: Here’s the latest on COVID-19 vaccines.)
Further tests would be needed to judge how much the 2P mutation contributes to the overall efficacies of the frontrunner vaccines. Phil Dormitzer, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer and vice president of viral vaccines, says it’s “absolutely clear” that stabilizing prefusion proteins led to remarkable advances with potential RSV vaccines. “I’m very glad we picked those mutations to move forward,” he says, referring to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
Graham doesn’t quite know how to answer when asked how it feels to have decades’ worth of work contribute to rapidly developed vaccines that could save hundreds of thousands of lives amid a harrowing global pandemic. “That's not the way we usually think about it,” he says. “I don’t think you really think that much about your feelings until you get to certain milestones.”
But the question—posed using the phrase “such a time as this”—makes Graham hearken back to the biblical tale of Esther, a queen who was made a royal for “such a time as this.”

I also took virology but in 2006. I don’t even remember what I learned about coronaviruses though I do remember living through SARS and the panic it caused, which you said was before you were born. How much do you remember from ~~classes you took 12 years ago?~~(edit: I have a math learning disability lol) the early ‘00s? How much does anyone remember?

I took virology again in 2009 in veterinary school, which was several orders of magnitude more difficult but again - there wasn’t much focus on coronavirus. I remember learning what it did in dogs and that we have a vaccine for them, but that’s about it. I also learned about rinderpest and smallpox and how they were eradicated because veterinarians are considered frontline defenders for zoonotic diseases. In my 8 years so far of practice, I’ve seen only one case of coronavirus that some other doctor confirmed with an expensive special send out test. It ended up being irrelevant to the patient. I’ve had to do a huge degree of brushing up on my virology this year, and my past education merely gave me a deeper and broader baseline understanding. 

Coronaviruses are NOT “relatively unable” to mutate - did you even read the article? Did you read the part about the three letter deletions? Do you have the knowledge base to understand why diseases get worse with every species they jump through because of what it does to mutations? That’s why bird flu and swine flu were so bad. You may not see rapid, dramatic mutations in a single person or region, however, it’s like pulling the handle on a genetic slot machine any time a virus jumps to an animal due to differences in their genetic code. The virus has spread across the entire globe faster than any disease ever has in all of human history. Different countries are spontaneously getting different mutations, and some spread more quickly than others. Different mink farms are also seeing different genetic variants - cluster 5 was just one of several already found. They’re little mutation machines, just like bats.

The scary stuff happens when a virus hops back from animals to people, hence why the mink situation needs to be monitored extremely closely - as the article also explains. Yes, SARS1 and the scary mutation to the spike protein in mink disappeared as spontaneously as they came, but it’s naive and foolish to think that correlates with safety. 

Now think about what happens if a farmer gives SARS-2 to his minks, the minks pass it among themselves like wildfire because of the abhorrent way they are housed, they give it to a barn cat who gives it back to more minks (maybe at the farm down the road), and the minks give it back to a person - now what sort of mutations has it accumulated? Every species jump mixes up genetic data. Denmark has already seen a single farm have two separate SARS2 outbreaks and the second was genetically different from the first. The farmer was hopeful that his surviving flock could breed covid resistant animals but the second outbreak was just as devastating as the first. Now they are all dead from the cull. They’ve also found that 4/5 wild minks in Denmark were born on mink farms (farm minks eat ocean fish, wild eat freshwater fish, and the difference can be molecularly identified in their teeth and claws) so it’s safe to assume more than a handful of mink from impacted farms have escaped. It’s unlikely a positive mink would - at least 30% are dead (sometimes way more) within 1-3 days of symptoms first being observed. Several mink also escaped during the cull (there’s video of this) and there’s also pictures and video of overflowing trucks spilling dead, rotting mink along KILOMETERS of road (we learned in March/April that dead bodies are infectious when morgue attendants, pathologists, and body handlers started dying). I’ve seen video of farmers who put most of their dead minks in huge dumpsters or shipping containers they could close but they didn’t all fit so they just left the extra ones in nasty piles out in the open while they wait for the gov’t to send out trucks to pick them up. He said he couldn’t stop the foxes from coming to get them. Dead minks are bubbling up out of mass graves wreaking similar environmental havoc. There are 3x as many minks in Denmark than there are humans. 

Let’s not forget that states with the largest mink populations, like Utah and Wisconsin, are also experiencing catastrophic human outbreaks. Correlation doesn’t imply causation, but I definitely worry about US mink farmers going bar hopping on the weekend. God help us if they are anti-maskers. The mink versions aren’t worse, per se, but they definitely speed up the mutation process in a region. I haven’t seen much data/research from the US about our own minks, which worries me.

I should have been a bit more nuanced about the elements that I assume were incorrect in your response.


Firstly, although I shared the BBC article because it's both a much easier read for most users here that are not health professionals or researchers, but also because it's from journalists that have been given close access to the work from the Oxford University from the beginning. I've looked at the still technical but summarised data from AstraZeneca's press release, which is quite informative about the specific details of all 4 trials.

https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222-oxford-phase-iii-trials-interim-analysis-results-published-in-the-lancet.html#


To be more specific as to what I considered to be incorrect on your original comment and to be a bit more nuanced about it. It seems like comments like: 

We are just looking at the Phase 3 trial results, where the AZ effectiveness rates were nowhere near the mRNA based vaccines. The data clearly shows it is inferior, and the only group that showed high effectiveness rates was not demographically diverse and the result of a manufacturing error.


First of all, you are confusing ""efficacy"" and ""effectiveness"" which are 2 different things in epidemiology (1) (2). Currently, we only know ""efficacy"" as these are clinical trials. You will notice that all the papers and press releases talk about an ""efficacy"" rate.

https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html
https://www.who.int/influenza_vaccines_plan/resources/Session4_VEfficacy_VEffectiveness.PDF


Additionally, what I believe made me say that you were incorrect is that your response was the hyperbole and fearmongering, while you also conflated facts with your personal opinions.

the only group that showed high effectiveness rates was not demographically diverse and the result of a manufacturing error.
If AZ can’t even correctly make vaccines to use in their trials, I have questions about their ability to manufacture it consistently at scale.


The article I linked clearly indicated the issue that transpired right at the start of the trials, and how they addressed it with transparency and corrected the dosage (the issue was not with manufacturing per se, i.e. a bad batch, but different standards that let to different dosages as the researchers took the safest approach). The way you describe the ""manufacturing"" problem insinuates that not only they manufactured it incorrectly but and I'll quote: ""I have questions about their ability to manufacture it consistently at scale."" which is not only hyperbole but also a bit disingenuous considering that the small facility used to manufacture 500 doses is unlikely to be the one that will manufacture millions of doses. AstraZeneca is not some tiny random manufacturer unaware of the challenges of producing a vaccine. Not to mention, there was a massive lockdown in place which made logistics much harder and probably compounded the difficulty that the Oxford team was already experiencing.

Lastly, you talk about superiority of the vaccines but once again, for a vaccine to be useful it only needs to have a greater than 50% efficacy. The Oxford vaccine exceeds most of the flu vaccines even in the ""full dosage"" groups. And more importantly, NONE of the participants required hospitalization, which is a MASSIVE win.

I'm on mobile so responding in detail is not very easy. But I hope the above gives you a glimpse of some of the things I disagreed with on your response.

Overall, and this is just my sentiment and I'm not saying that your comment was in any way related to what I'm about to say, but I find it pretty sad that even at a point where hundreds of thousands have lost their lives and more are dying each day, people still seem to be putting nationalist bias ahead of the greater good, and ""colouring"" their views based on the US, China, Russia or UK origins of these vaccines.

I hope ALL of the vaccines work out and that thanks to their combined production output and efficacy, we rid the world of this terrible virus that has affected everyone in such negative ways. I don't care if AstraZeneca is British/Swedish or that Sinopharm is Chinese. I care that they have vaccines that are cheaper to produce and much easier to distribute and store, that will likely make vaccination much faster and accessible (not just to the richest countries). I care that the new vaccines from Pfizer & BioNTech / Moderna have higher efficacy rate and have been proven to work in more demographics because despite their cost and distribution/storage complexities, they have already allowed so many health and essential workers, the elderly and also family members of mine to be vaccinated in both the US (medical) and the UK (elderly). They will likely be used over time for more at risk populations that will be more reassured with the higher protection or richer countries that can afford both the extra cost and more expensive refrigeration necessary, freeing up the other vaccines for elsewhere.

On the BioNtech Homepage you can find more information about their collaboration:

“The collaboration with Pfizer builds on the 2018 agreement to jointly develop an mRNA-based influenza vaccine. It aims to rapidly advance multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates into human clinical testing based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA vaccine platforms, with the objective of ensuring rapid worldwide access to the vaccine, if approved. The collaboration will leverage Pfizer’s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network. During the clinical development stage, BioNTech and its partners will provide clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe. BioNTech and Pfizer will work together to scale-up manufacturing capacity at risk to provide worldwide supply in response to the pandemic. BioNTech and Pfizer will also work jointly to commercialize the vaccine worldwide (excluding China which is already covered by BioNTech’s collaboration with Fosun Pharma) upon regulatory approval.

As part of their strategic collaboration announced in March 2020, BioNTech and Fosun Pharma will jointly conduct clinical trials of BNT162 in China, leveraging BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA vaccine technology and Fosun Pharma’s clinical development and commercialization capabilities in China. Fosun Pharma will commercialize the vaccine in China upon regulatory approval.”

From the [Lancet article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext) (12/8/2020):

*The LD/SD cohort* ***(aged 18–55 years)*** *was enrolled over 11 days between May 31 and June 10, 2020. The SD/SD cohort (aged 18–55 years) was enrolled from June 9 to July 20, 2020.* ***Subsequently, enrolment of older age cohorts*** *began (from Aug 8, 2020, for participants aged 56–69 years and from Aug 13, 2020, for participants aged ≥70 years),* ***all of whom were assigned to two standard doses*** *(SD/SD cohort).* 

I can't explain the difference between the information above and the article you cited . . . but that's because of the sponsors' lack of transparency. I have read various news sources where people associated with the project even reject the idea that giving the lower dose to this relatively small cohort was the result of a manufacturing error (or miscommunication or whatever they are calling it these days). If they would just say one thing and stick with it, it would inspire a lot more confidence. 

I don't have any issue with the vaccine itself. On the contrary, overall it's the best technology out there given its potential efficacy and cost and capacity to manufacture. This only makes the sponsors' mismanagement more of a problem, not less. 

But now the vaccine is seeking approval and no one knows what dose they should use. It's possible (statistically) that the LD/SD dose is exactly as effective as the SD/SD dose. It's also possible that the SD/SD dose is >50% effective (again, statistically). We sure don't know based on the data available. 

I've worked in and around the pharma world since the early 90s. I know that there ""you can't be exactly sure about the dose upfront."" But this is probably a really big miss on one of the most high profile drugs of our lifetime. Or maybe the LD/SD data is a fluke and the drug really isn't any better than \~62% effective. I don't really believe that and I doubt many people do. So either the vaccine is mediocre or they mismanaged the dose. 

I'll repeat what I said in my post above because I stand by it:

**1.** Mention in your explanation as to why this vaccine was so quick to develop the huge resources put towards it, but more importantly that one reason trials can be completed so fast is because the high number of infections in a pandemic. 

Most vaccine trials take a long time because it takes a long time to get a statistically significant sample, since you're not actively infecting anyone and have to wait for a certain number of people to get infected naturally.

It has been approved in the *UK*, but neither the European Union nor any other European country has approved it.  Also, India likely approved it because the UK did.

Second, the US isn't ""waiting until April,"" but some people have stated that's when it might be approved.  The simple fact is that it's not even possible to approve at this point because Astrazeneca hasn't even applied for approval in the U.S. (or EU for that matter).  

They probably haven't applied because they know there's a good chance they'll get rejected without U.S. data, especially when the data from other countries suffers from so many problems (many mistakes, low sample size, etc.).  These problems will  *hopefully* be resolved when the next month or two with the conclusion of Astrazeneca's trials in the U.S.  Because of mistakes, the sample size for any particular regimen of administering the vaccine is anywhere from 1/15 to 1/5 the size of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, depending upon which regimen you look at.  (Pfizer and Moderna tested just one regimen, whereas Astrazeneca ""tested"" about 5 across 12k people in the trials that have been released, because of differences in trials in the UK and Brazil, in addition to the many mistakes that were made during the trials (including incorrect dosages and incorrect timing of vaccine administration).)

The truth is, the UK is really going past the science in their approval.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but that's a fact.  They have advised that doses for both Astrazeneca and Pfizer should be given 12 weeks apart, and that individuals who receive one particular vaccine first can receive the other vaccine second.  Necessary?  Will it save lives? Probably.  But not grounded in trials that actually tested this, particularly for Pfizer.  And this recommendation has been done against Pfizer's own admonishment that there is no data to support this regimen actually working for their vaccine.  The UK is engaging in what one might call ""armchair"" science.  Normally, we have a hypothesis and test it.  They have a hypothesis, and are determining conditions are so dire that they must act on it without testing it first, because based on our experience with other vaccines, this will *probably* be good.

There's also the fact that the U.S. simply doesn't need more vaccine at this moment.  Right now, the hold up isn't the number of vaccines, it's administration of vaccines.

The Pfizer and Moderna trials were well designed, simple trials. Large sample size, randomized (but well-matched cohorts), well defined primary outcome. And because both vaccines are very, very similar, two large trials with essentially identical results essentially doubles the confidence in each vaccine. I will be getting the Pfizer vaccine, hopefully soon (healthcare worker).

The AZ-oxford studies, on the other hand, have been a mess. One of the UK arms capped age at 55 (which happened to have the highest efficiency), there was the dosing error, and they're publishing a combined trial. The degree of heterogeneity within the combined trials, and the use of post-hoc subgroup analyses is a major red flag. Maybe you can just treat the Brazil trial as a worse case scenario (30-80% effective 95% CI), but it still feels post-hoc. They did get some reasonable amount of safety data from the trial, if not great efficacy data (and they also had a branch that looked at asymptomatic infection). But if they want to be approved in the US, they will have to do a large prospective, randomized trial.

This is disappointing because the AZ-Oxford vaccine had the potential to be cheap, effective, and not have the cold chain issues. But here we are, and if we expediently approve a vaccine and it doesn't work or there are safety issues it could significantly undermine vaccine confidence in the future, which is tragic because we have good vaccines, including to COVID19."

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/health-55280671

That's the info I have and that's also what I have read in other sources so far. I am not aware of any official plan to use half doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine. If you mean the timing of the vaccine then what I think that was supported by evidence shown in the trial and you will need sources to convince me otherwise.

>The criticism has been widely reported on, although mostly in foreign media, so if you are only getting your news from the BBC you may not be getting a full and honest assessment.  

Despite your objections against the BBC I do find them to be a reliable source but no, it's not my main source of info since English isn't even my mother tongue. I mainly use the BBC when I need an English source for the info I have read in another language since most other sources are pure garbage (the local for example).

>>	Some scientists say Britain is gambling with its new guidance. “There are no data on this idea whatsoever,” said John Moore, a vaccine expert at Cornell University. Officials in Britain “seem to have abandoned science completely now and are just trying to guess their way out of a mess.” 

This doesn't even support the claim you were trying to make. Yes it's a valid criticism, one that I wasn't aware of. But it isn't a valid criticism for the half dose or the Astra Zeneca vaccine itself, which is what your original claim was. Again, you are discounting my arguments by changing the topic and if you continue to do so then I will stop discussing this with you. 

>Trials are underway to confirm a variety of other theories - will a half second dose be more effective? 

I'm not aware half doses are being considered. Source?

>Can adenovirus vectored vaccines be mixed and matched?

Not relevant to the original argument that we should be sceptical about Astra Zeeca specifically but valid criticism.

You know when you go shopping and see a store say ""save upto 90%"" but really it has one shirt size xxxxl on  sale 90% but everything else in the store is 20% off?  Its like that. 

On average they are putting it at 70%  the low end is 62%  those are the numbers for the vast majority of those enrolled in the study. Regular dose followed by regular dose.  

However a very small group (like 2500) got half dose followed by a higher dose. 

There was a lot of concern and confusion about the dosing and why it worked better. The AZ ceo said, oh that was an accident. Called it ""serendipity "".  He said that group got half the dose and no one realized it until they found that group had lower adverse events and side effects. Oops. But they decided to give the higher dose and they saw upto 90% efficacy. What luck!  Oxford head said well actually the manufacturer ""(not AZ)"" gave the researchers a lessened amount of drug and they realized it pretty quick. They asked committee  what should they do and the committee said go forward and give a higher dose. They expected the low dose higher dose to be equally effective as normal dose x2. That would have good luck for them. 

As a general rule of thumb, you say we are going to test this by a very strict set of guidelines and rules. The fact that it didnt happen is bad. The fact that their normal dosing didnt work as expected doesnt help. 

Astrazenaca has said two things, hey everyone we're cheaper and hey lower doses means more doses for everyone. That is also a big spin and doesnt help build confidence.  If it wasnt homegrown at oxford then I think the uk regulators would be shutting it down or asking even harder questions."	"""Up to""

Very farsighted decison making on his part in this pandemic. Of course, he's also put his money on a couple more vaccines. Not the mRNA ones though. Another company in India called Dr. Reddy's Labs has signed a big deal with Sputnik V, which reported 92-95% efficacy just today. So India will be providing vaccines to a large part of Asia's and Africa's poor nations. It will take time, however, because India is now almost a fifth of humanity.

Amazing that they want to complicate the criteria for who gets the vaccine when age is such a huge risk factor and dwarfs all other factors, even obesity, and is simultaneously the easiest factor administratively.

[**What The COVID Vaccine Hype Fails To Mention**  ](https://mises.org/wire/what-covid-vaccine-hype-fails-mention)

>*Both trials have a treatment group that received the  vaccine and a control group that did not. All the trial subjects were  covid negative prior to the start of the trial. The analysis for both  trials was performed when a target number of “cases” were reached.  “Cases” were defined by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  testing. There was no information about the cycle number for the PCR  tests. There was no information about whether the “cases” had symptoms  or not. There was no information about hospitalizations or deaths. The  Pfizer study had 43,538 participants and was analyzed after 164 cases.  So, roughly 150 out 21,750 participants (less than 0.7%) became PCR  positive in the control group and about one-tenth that number in the  vaccine group became PCR positive.*   
 *The Moderna trial had 30,000 participants. There were 95 “cases”  in the 15,000 control participants (about 0.6%) and 5 “cases” in the  15,000 vaccine participants (about one-twentieth of 0.6%). The  “efficacy” figures quoted in these announcements are odds ratios. There  is no evidence, yet, that the vaccine prevented any hospitalizations or  any deaths. The Moderna announcement claimed that eleven cases in the  control group were “severe” disease, but “severe” was not defined. If  there were any hospitalizations or deaths in either group, the public  has not been told.*  
 *When the risks of an event are small, odds ratios can be misleading  about absolute risk. A more meaningful measure of efficacy would be the  number to vaccinate to prevent one hospitalization or one death. Those  numbers are not available.* ***An estimate of the number to treat from  the Moderna trial to prevent a single “case” would be fifteen thousand  vaccinations to prevent ninety “cases” or 167 vaccinations per “case”  prevented which does not sound nearly as good as 94.5% effective.***  
 *The publicists working for pharmaceutical companies are very smart people.* ***If  there were a reduction in mortality from these vaccines, that  information would be in the first paragraph of the announcement.***  
 *There is no information about how long any protective benefit from  the vaccine would persist. Antibody response following covid-19 appears  to be short lived. Based on what we know, the covid vaccine may require  two shots every three to six months to be protective. The more shots  required, the greater the risk of side effects from sensitization to the  vaccine.* ***There is no information about safety. None****. Government  agencies like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) appear to have two  completely different standards for attributing deaths to covid-19 and  attributing side effects to covid vaccines.*  
 *If these vaccines are approved, as they likely will be, the first  group to be vaccinated will be the beta testers. I am employed by a  university-based medical center that is a referral center for the West  Texas region. My colleagues include resident physicians and faculty  physicians who work with covid patients on a daily basis. I have asked a  number of my colleagues whether they will be first in line for the new  vaccine. I have yet to hear any of my colleagues respond affirmatively.*  
 *The reasons for hesitancy are that the uncertainties  about safety exceed what they perceive to be a small benefit. In other  words,* ***my colleagues would prefer to take their chances with covid rather than beta test the vaccine****.  Many of my colleagues want to see the safety data after a year of use  before getting vaccinated; these colleagues are concerned about possible  autoimmune side effects that may not appear for months after  vaccination.*"	All the trial subjects were covid negative prior to the start of the trial.	0	1	[0.00733163 0.9926684 ]	1	[0.04317601 0.95682395]	1	[0.00237205 0.997628  ]	1	17605	0							"The Moderna announcement claimed that eleven cases in the control group were “severe” disease, but “severe” was not defined.

When we do board an aircraft, we use baby wipes to clean our entire row of seats, seat belts, tray tables, and the seat back in front of us to remove peanut dust and residue. In spite of our best efforts to minimize allergen exposure to our daughter, flying is still a very stressful event. The few times we have flown, she invariably sneezes, scratches, and breaks out in hives; a far cry from anaphylaxis (which she has experienced, unfortunately), but still a real possibility that keeps us on edge throughout the entire flight. We do carry EpiPens and Benadryl everywhere we go, but for those who think having medication on hand in case of an allergic reaction is analogous to having spare Pampers on hand to change to dirty diaper, you are incredibly out of touch with reality, uninformed on the issue, or both.

We try to fly peanut-allergy-friendly airlines when it is not cost prohibitive. When we do board an aircraft, we use baby wipes to clean our entire row of seats, seat belts, tray tables, and the seat back in front of us to remove peanut dust and residue. In spite of our best efforts to minimize allergen exposure to our daughter, flying is still a very stressful event. The few times we have flown, she invariably sneezes, scratches, and breaks out in hives; a far cry from anaphylaxis (which she has experienced, unfortunately), but still a real possibility that keeps us on edge throughout the entire flight. We do carry EpiPens and Benadryl everywhere we go, but for those who think having medication on hand in case of an allergic reaction is analogous to having spare Pampers on hand to change to dirty diaper, you are incredibly out of touch with reality, uninformed on the issue, or both.

432	432	[174, 183]	My son is severely allergic to peanuts and has allergic reactions as a result of being around people eating peanuts due to the peanut dust in the air. We had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist. The airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks. My son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip. Since he didn't eat any peanuts, we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat. We were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country. We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight. We may not be so lucky next time because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last. Even though we were on a peanut-free fight, my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight. If peanuts are banned on all flights, my son would have been safe.

This isn't speculation, but rather the only conclusion that can be drawn from the USA's prior history of judicially mandated sterilization. One of the stated purposes [1] of the program was to prevent harm to children by rendering sterile those people who had demonstrated themselves to be abusive or neglectful to their children. In practice what happened was that the program was used to sterilize as many poor white people and black people as the law could manage (even when there was no evidence of abuse or neglect), and that rich white people were simply not forcibly sterilized even when abundant evidence of abuse existed.

1000	999	[978]	Five years ago, I drastically cut back my consumption of meat and animal products. This was mostly for selfish reasons - my health. My new way of eating took some getting used to, and required a lot of effort learning how to cook tasty meat-free dishes. But over time I found that I took more pleasure in eating than ever before. Almost miraculously, my taste buds seemed to grow in sensitivity once the dominant flavors of animal meat and fat were removed, allowing me to enjoy a new world of culinary experiences. I love my whole foods, plant-based diet and will never go back. There's plenty of evidence to show that reducing meat and dairy consumption has health benefits (reduced heart disease, stroke, diabetes, etc).

1021	1020	[1012]	Now I've been using the Lenovo for about 2 months, and I'm starting to realize that I miss a lot of the things about Mac OSX and how it babies you. The Y510p is hardly portable. I'm realizing that PC gaming just isn't what I thought it would be, or maybe I haven't given it enough time - since I came mostly from a childhood of Nintendo and Playstation consoles for my games. It's already past the point of the return policy, So I'm left with very little options. I already sold my MacBook Pro for $420 on ebay to help pay towards this laptop that I'm on now. I realize Reddit users are mostly Windows users, but please, CMV in convincing me out of my buyer's remorse. Should I just suck it up and learn the Windows ecosystem better? Should I try to sell / return this Lenovo somehow and get another MacBook without swallowing too much of a loss? * * Also, a very niche thing - but I type in Chinese quite a bit with friends in Taiwan, so I use Traditional Chinese (PinYin) input on the keyboard. Typing Chinese was such a breeze on OSX especially with how the candidate list pops out and you can just choose the character by hitting the number. On Windows, there isn't such an option for Traditional Chinese PinYin (but there is for Simplified, which boggles me). I know that most of Taiwan doesn't even use PinYin, but ZhuYin instead which is why I'm in such a niche minority of people who want to type Chinese.

1099	1098	[1140]	Ellie, you just keep digging yourself in deeper and deeper. I didn't just quote a few random vegans, I quoted people at the top of the largest veg orgs in the Nation. In other words, I had no problem at all demonstrating that it is not just fringe groups or something at the margins of the movement. Your claim that Bruce Friedrich is not a vegan was particularly laughable. You should have learned who he was before making such an embarrassingly ridiculous claim. Friedrich's life is dedicated to veganism. He even wrote the infamous essay, Defending Agitation and the ALF, which is a defense of the ALF's terrorist tactics, which the organization uses to justify their terrorism to this day. Again, Farm Sanctuary is one of the most prominent vegan orgs, not some fringe group within the movement. I got a good laugh out of your claim that I don't know vegans. My wife was one for years, and I have known many, many vegans. I also know people who have been threatened and attacked by vegan activists. For example, an acquaintance, a small, physically handicapped, middle-aged woman who was violently attacked by three vegan activists in the middle of a speech about the essential importance of animals in sustainable ag systems. It was very, very funny that you tried to deny any comparisons being made between omnivores and Nazis, and then did that yourself in the very same breath. Again, I proved it, and even cited a specific case here, so your claim is completely fallacious.		['INDIVIDUAL', 'GROUP']	2.0	1.0	FIRST-HAND	False	STORY	CLARIFICATION	veganism	veganism97.txt

1235	1234	[1345]	"Ever since the first reports of its ""keylogging"" (removed before the end of the open beta, I am aware), and later with how pushy Microsoft has been, plus the whole ""Windows 10 style"" I have thought this OS was a bad idea. I only finally caved in and upgraded my laptop after a few months of trying various Linux distros (Kubuntu, Linux Mint, Ubuntu (I have tried a dozen various Linux distros over the decades, but always gravitated back to Windows)), and eventually gravitated back to Windows once again. But I did upgrade my Windows 8 laptop to 10. So I have been giving it a sort of test drive. And it's been one disappointment after another. At first install, I navigated the hard-to-find ""Customize settings"" link. It was easy enough to use after finding it, though I became more stunned with every page at seeing how invasive the default settings were. I gave each option a fair assessment and when I looked back at my choices, I had turned everything off. I live in Brazil so Cortana was never even installed. It doesn't exist here. I have given the new ""live tile"" ""MS Store"" ""apps"" a fair chance and I find them all so bad. I like the concept of the rearrangeable, visual Start menu, but I don't like any of the live tiles or the new version apps. I even went looking for (and found) a ""Classic Calculator"" program that installs the W7 calc.exe. I can launch it by typing `Windows + R` - & gt; `Enter` - & gt; `calc` - & gt; `Enter`, and it's faster and has more features (editable history; date calculation; less screen real estate) than the new calculator app. I have spent more than an hour trying to set Picture and Fax Viewer (or Photo Viewer) as the default image handler, but unsuccessfully.

No, I don't want to use a PIN to sign into my computer. It was a pain to find out where to disconnect the live account from my local user. I appreciate many of the UI improvements they are implementing, but the interface looks awful in my eyes. Everything takes up way too much space on the screen – way too many pixels – and the new shell is just not well integrated with the classic explorer.exe shell. The right click menus are all wrong. The new user account separation is much appreciated, but the OS shows me way too little information. I have far too little fine control over the system. Half the GUI is in the old interface, half is in the new one. I have had the explorer.exe shell crash while the new shell keeps working, and vice versa. I read that Windows 10 boots significantly faster than Windows 7... Well, I already have an SSD and my machine already boots faster than my monitor takes to power on."

Most of the times that a judge was declaring a credit card default, they were propping up the overpricing of a monopolistic credit card debt suspension insurance policy that did not fairly give consumers the most obvious way to protect themselves from a default that was caused by life changing event We could literally fix the U.S. economy almost overnight by doing the right thing.

Everyone refused, and the harrassing and MORE IMPORTANTLY REPETITIVE phone calls started. I ended up having to convert my land lines to 6 dollar a month cell phones, and then I rarely used them because I could not afford the 20 cents a minute cost.

In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes. Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS. I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety. I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.
